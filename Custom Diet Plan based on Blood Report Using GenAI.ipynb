The concentration of HBA1c in the cell reflects the average blood glucose concentration it encounters. •The level of HBA1c increases proportionately in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. It reflects the average blood glucose concentration over an extended time period and remains unaffected by short-term fluctuations in blood glucose levels. •The measurement of HbA1c can serve as a convenient test for evaluating the adequacy of diabetic control and in preventing various diabetic complications. Because the average half life of a red blood cell is sixty days, HbA1c has been accepted as a measurement which reflects the mean daily blood glucose concentration, better than fasting blood glucose determination, and the degree of carbohydrate imbalance over the preceding two months. •It may also provide a better index of control of the diabetic patient without resorting to glucose loading procedures. HbA1c assay Interferences : Erroneous values might be obtained from samples with abnormally elevated quantities of other Haemoglobins as a result of either their simultaneous elution with HbA1c (HbF) or differences in their glycation from that of HbA (HbS).

A ratio of albumin:creatinine of 300 or higher is indicative of overt proteinuria. Due to biologic variability, positive results should be confirmed by a second, first-morning random or 24-hour timed urine specimen. If there is discrepancy, a third specimen is recommended. When 2 out of 3 results are in the microalbuminuria range, this is evidence for incipient nephropathy and warrants increased efforts at glucose control, blood pressure control, and institution of therapy with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (if the patient can tolerate it).

Treatment of moderate hyperhomocystinemia with folic acid supplementation for primary and secondary cardiovascular protection has met with inconsistent results and at present cannot be routinely recommended. Limitations: •The plasma must be seprated immediately on collection to avoid continuous synthesis of Hcy by red cells. •Samples must be immediately stored on ice and serum centrifuged immediately before a complete clot is formed. •Certain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, methotrexate, or nitrous oxide, may interfere with the assay. •Cigarette smoking and coffee consumption increase tHcy levels. •Intraindividual variability is approximately 8%; it can be as much as 25% in patients with hyperhomocystinemia. •Generally, a single measurement of tHcy is considered adequate.

Interpretation: Increased In • Vitamin D intoxication • Excessive exposure to sunlight Decreased In • Malabsorption • Steatorrhea • Dietary osteomalacia, anticonvulsant osteomalacia • Biliary and portal cirrhosis • Thyrotoxicosis • Pancreatic insufficiency • Celiac disease • Rickets • Alzheimer disease Limitations: More recently, it has become clear that receptors for vitamin D are present in a wide variety of cells and that this hormone has biologic effects extending beyond the control of mineral metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency is not clear. Levels needed to prevent rickets and osteomalacia ( 15 ng/mL) are lower than those that dramatically suppress parathyroid hormone levels (20 –30 ng/mL). In turn, those levels are lower than levels needed to optimize intestinal calcium absorption (34 ng/mL). Neuromuscular peak performance is associated with levels approximately 38 ng/mL. A recent study states that increasing mean baseline levels from 29 to 38 ng/mL was associated with a 50% lower risk for colon cancer and levels of 52 ng/mL with a 50% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer. It is recommended to have clinical correlation with serum 25(OH)vitamin D, serum calcium, serum PTH & serum alkaline phosphatase. Immunoassay Test Result Unit Biological Ref.

Interpretation: • Increased In : Chronic granulocytic leukemia , COPD and Chronic renal failure , Leukocytosis , Liver cell damage (hepatitis, cirrhosis) , Obesity and Severe CHF , Polycythemia vera , Protein malnutrition. • Decreased In : Abnormalities of cobalamin transport or metabolism , Bacterial overgrowth , Crohn disease , Dietary deficiency (e.g. in vegetarians) , Diphyllobothrium (fish tapeworm) infestation , Gastric or small intestine surgery , Hypochlorhydria , Inflammatory bowel diseas , Intestinal malabsorption and Intrinsic factor deficiency Limitations: • Drugs such as chloral hydrate increase vitamin B12 levels. On the other hand , alcohol, aminosalicylic acid, anticonvulsants, ascorbic acid, cholestyramine, cimetidine, colchicines, metformin, neomycin, oral contraceptives, ranitidine, and triamterene decrease vitamin B12 levels. • The evaluation of macrocytic anemia requires measurements of both vitamin B12 and folate levels; ideally they should be measured simultaneously. • Specimen collection soon after blood transfusion can falsely increase vitamin B12 levels. • Patients taking vitamin B12 supplementation may have misleading results. • A normal serum concentration of B12 does not rule out tissue deficiency of vitamin B12. The most sensitive test for B12 deficiency at the cellular level is the assay for MMA. If clinical symptoms suggest deficiency, measurement of MMA and homocysteine should be considered, even if serum B12 concentrations are normal. Immunoassay Test Result Unit Biological Ref.

PSA is constantly expressed in nearly all prastate cancers, although its level of expression on a percell basis is lower than in normal prostate epithelium. The absolute value of serum PSA is useful for determining the extent of prostate cancer and assessing the response to prostate cancer treatment; its use as a screening method to detect prostate cancer is also common. Interpretation Increased in • Prostate disease (Cancer, Prostatitis, Benign prostatic hyperplasia, Acute urinary retention) • Manipulations ( Cystoscopy, Needle biopsy, Radiation therapy, Indwelling catheter, Prostatic massage) • Transurethral resection • Prostatic ischemia Decreased in • Castration • Prostatectomy • Radiation therapy • Ejaculation withi 24 - 48 hours • 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor reduces PSA by 50% after 6 months in men without cancer Limitations • PSA has been recommended by the American Cancer Society for use in conjunction with a DRE for early detection of prostate cancer starting at the age of 50 years for men with at least 10 year life expectancy • PSA levels that are measured repeatedly over time may vary because of biologic variability where the true PSA level in a given man is different on different measurements. • A change in PSA of >30% in man with a PSA initially below 2.0 ng/mL was likely to indicate a true change beyond normal random variation.

Presence of symptoms, and hyposensitization treatment • Parasitic diseases (e.g. ascariasis, visceral larva migrans, hookworm disease, schistosomiasis, Echinococcus infestation) • Monoclonal IgE myeloma - Decreased In • Hereditary deficiencies • Acquired immunodeficiency • Ataxia-telangiectasis • Non-IgE myeloma Limitations: • A normal level of IgE in serum does not eliminate the possibility of allergic disease. • Serum total IgE levels for the majority of individuals with IgE-mediated disease can be expected to be elevated compared to the reference range for healthy adults. However, not all allergic patients exhibit elevated serum total IgE levels. •Since not all atopic reactions are IgE-mediated, a total IgE result in the reference range should always be interpreted in light of other clinical observations. • Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with the immunoglobulins included in the assay components causing interference with in vitro immunoassays.

A NON REACTIVE result implies that no Anti HIV-1 or HIV -2 antibodies have been detected in the sample by this method. This means that either the patient has not been exposed to HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection or the sample has been tested during the \"WINDOW PHASE\" (before the development of detectable levels of antibodies). 2. A PROVISIONALITY REACTIVE / BORDERLINE REACTIVE result suggests possibility of HIV-1 or/and HIV-2 infection. However these results must be verified by confirmatory WESTERN BLOT / HIV PCR method before declaring the patient positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection. 3. Very high levels of IgM Antibodies or Anti-HLA ABC and DR Antibodies can give false positive reaction. **Pre & Post test counselling for HIV testing is responsibility of reffering Physician.

      "This chapter will summarize current information available from a variety of evidence-based guidelines \n",
      "and resources on dietary advice for those with diabetes. The modern diet for those with diabetes is \n",
      "based on concepts from clinical research, portion control, and individualized lifestyle change. It \n",
      "requires open and honest communication between health care practitioner and patient and cannot be \n",
      "delivered by giving a person a diet sheet in a one-size-fits- all approach. The lifestyle modification \n",
      "guidance and support needed most often requires a team effort, ideally including a registered dietitian \n",
      "(RD) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), or a referral to a diabetes self- management education \n",
      "and support (DSMES) program that includes dietary advice. Current (2024) recommendations of the \n",
      "American Diabetes Association (ADA) promote all health care professionals to refer people with \n",
      "diabetes for individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) provided by an RDN at diagnosis and as \n",
      "needed throughout the life span, in addition to DSMES (1). It is very important to note that dietary \n",
      "recommendations for those with diabetes are virtually the same recommendations for diabetes \n",
      "prevention and the health of the general population; however, it cannot be excluded that people with \n",
      "diabetes will require additional support to meet the recommendations. \n",

      "Fang et al, reported that although there has been continued improvements in risk factor control and \n",
      "adherence to preventative practices over the past decades, half of U.S. adults with diabetes do not meet \n",
      "the recommended goals for diabetes care in 2015-2018 (2). This is a current and ongoing issue. Diet \n",
      "and lifestyle recommendations are cornerstones of advice to prevent and manage diabetes, however \n",
      "there are recognized barriers to heeding advice and implementing lifestyle change. First, there is a \n",
      "plethora of dietary information for diabetes management available from many sources, although not \n",
      "all is evidence-based or current. There are also social, cultural, and personal preferences unique to \n",
      "each individual that must be taken into consideration when making long-term dietary change. Many \n",
      "health care practitioners are not adequately trained to be confident in delivering dietary advice, and \n",
      "many food environments do not support healthy dietary intakes for all. There are also commercial \n",
      "determinants of health that influence dietary intakes, such as marketing advertising, and price \n",
      "discounting on certain foods. The following recommendations come from evidence-based guideline \n",

      "macronutrients. Based on available data, the best mix of carbohydrate, protein, and fat depends on the \n",
      "individual metabolic goals and preferences of the person with diabetes. It’s most important to ensure \n",
      "that total energy intake is kept in mind for weight loss or maintenance (1). \n",
      "CARBOHYDRATES \n",
      "The primary goal in the management of diabetes is to achieve as near normal regulation of blood \n",
      "glucose as possible. Both the type and total amount of carbohydrate (CHO) consumed influences \n",
      "glycemia. Carbohydrate intake should emphasize nutrient-dense carbohydrate sources that are high in \n",
      "fiber (at least 14 g fiber per 1,000 kcal) and minimally processed (1). Dietary carbohydrate includes \n",
      "sugars, starch, and dietary fiber. Higher intakes of sugars are associated with weight gain and greater \n",
      "incidence of dental caries (5). Conversely, higher intakes of dietary fiber are associated with reduced \n",
      "non-communicable disease and premature mortality occurrence as well as improvements in body \n",
      "weight, cholesterol concentrations, and blood pressure (6, 7). These benefits with higher fiber intakes \n",
      "have been observed in the general population, for those with type 1, type 2, and pre diabetes, (8) and \n",
      "those with hypertension or heart disease (9). With this guidance in mind, eating plans should \n",
      "emphasize non-starchy vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, as well as dairy products with \n",
      "minimal added sugars (1, 10). There is less consistency of evidence for recommending an amount of \n",

      "Dietary Fiber \n",
      "Current recommendations from the American Diabetes Association are that adults with diabetes \n",
      "should consume high fiber foods (at least 14g fiber per 1,000 kcal) (1). Current recommendations from \n",
      "the European Association for the Study of Diabetes are that adults with diabetes should consume at \n",
      "least 35g dietary fiber per day (or 16.7g per 1,000 kcal) (10). These two values are aligned, and higher \n",
      "than current World Health Organization recommendations for the general population of at least 25g \n",
      "dietary fiber per day, (7) although all three recommendations recognize a minimum intake level, with \n",
      "greater benefits observed with higher intakes. These values are appreciably higher than current dietary \n",
      "fiber intakes in the United States, which is approximately 16g per day. Our understanding of the \n",
      "importance of dietary fiber has changed in recent years. Dietary fiber is carbohydrate that is not \n",
      "digested by the stomach or absorbed in the GI tract. Instead, it is either degraded in the colon by the \n",
      "gut microbiota, or passes through the human body intact. Higher intakes of dietary fiber are associated \n",
      "with lower all-cause mortality, heart disease, T2 diabetes incidence, and certain cancers such \n",
      "colorectal cancer when compared with lower fiber intakes (6). The benefits for childhood intakes of \n",
      "dietary fiber and health outcomes later in life remain uncertain (12). There are several established \n",
      "physiological pathways that might explain these associations, such as reducing postprandial glycemia, \n",
      "competitive inhibition of saturated fat in the small intestine, and greater satiety leading to reduce \n",
      "subsequent intake. There are also more novel pathways proposed, such as modulation of the gut \n",
      "microbiota to increase branched and short chain fatty acids. Current recommendations by the World \n",
      "Health Organization are to obtain “naturally occurring dietary fiber as consumed in food” (7). Fiber \n",
      "supplements however are used frequently as additional dietary fiber sources, and may help individuals \n",
      "reach their fiber recommendations when sufficient amounts cannot be obtained from food alone. Fiber \n",
      "supplements can be extracted fiber (taken from a plant source) or synthetic. Few fiber supplements \n",
      "have been studied for physiological effectiveness to the same degree as inherent dietary fiber, so \n",
      "current best advice is to consume foods that are high in fiber (1, 7, 13). Recommended food sources of \n",
      "dietary fiber are minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, whole fruit and legumes (1, 7). An \n",
      "emphasis on minimally processed is made, as processing may reduce the benefits associated with \n",

      "of issues which remained unclear or controversial at the time of the Consul-\n",
      "tation. It was not originally thought that such an evidence-based consultation\n",
      "process would be so controversial, but the reality is that there are surprisingly\n",

      "the best available scientiﬁc information.\n",
      "When looking at recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) in industrialized\n",
      "countries over the last 25 years, it is noticeable that for some micronutrients\n",
      "these have gradually increased. The question is whether this is the result of\n",
      "better scientiﬁc knowledge and understanding of the biochemical role of the\n",
      "nutrients, or whether the criteria for setting requirement levels have changed,\n",
      "or a combination of both. The scientiﬁc knowledge base has vastly expanded,\n",
      "but it appears that more rigorous criteria for deﬁning recommended levels is\n",
      "also a key factor.\n",
      "RNIs for vitamins and minerals were initially established on the under-\n",
      "standing that they are meant to meet the basic nutritional needs of over 97%\n",
      "of the population. However, a fundamental criterion in industrialized coun-\n",
      "tries has become one of the presumptive role that these nutrients play in “pre-\n",
      "venting” an increasing range of disease conditions that characterize affected\n",
      "populations. The latter approach implies trying to deﬁne the notion of\n",
      "“optimal nutrition”, and this has been one of the factors nudging deﬁned\n",
      "requirements to still higher levels.\n",
      "This shift in the goal for setting RNIs is not without reason. The popula-\n",
      "tions that are targeted for prevention through “optimal nutrition” are char-\n",
      "acterized by sedentary lifestyles and longer life expectancy. The populations\n",
      "in industrialized countries are ageing, and concern for the health of the older\n",
      "person has grown accordingly. In contrast, the micronutrient needs of popu-\n",
      "lation groups in developing countries are still viewed in terms of millions\n",
      "experiencing deﬁciency, and are then more appropriately deﬁned as those that\n",
      "will satisfy basic nutritional needs of physically active younger populations.\n",
      "Nevertheless, one also needs to bear in mind the double burden of under- and\n",
      "overnutrition, which is growing rapidly in many developing countries.\n",
      "Concern has been raised about possible differences in micronutrient needs\n",
      "of populations with different lifestyles for a very practical reason. The logic\n",
      "behind the establishment of micronutrient needs of industrialized nations has\n",
      "come about at the same time as a large and growing demand for a wide variety\n",
      "of supplements and fortiﬁcants, and manufacturers have responded quickly\n",
      "to meet this market. This phenomenon could easily skew national strategies\n",
      "for nutritional development, with an increased tendency to seek to resolve the\n",

      "animals (4) resulted in a re-examination of osteoporosis in humans, notably\n",

      "but rather to an increase in bone resorption (5–8); this has had a profound\n",

      "with calcium-binding properties, collectively known as vitamin K-dependent\n",
      "proteins or Gla proteins. Thus far, the only unequivocal role of vitamin K \n",
      "in health is in the maintenance of normal coagulation. The vitamin K-\n",

      "factors II, VII, IX, and X, which have a haemostatic role (i.e. they are proco-\n",
      "agulants that arrest and prevent bleeding), and proteins C and S, which have\n",
      "an anticoagulant role (i.e. they inhibit the clotting process). Despite this\n",
      "duality of function, the overriding effect of nutritional vitamin K deﬁciency\n",
      "is a bleeding tendency caused by the relative inactivity of the procoagulant\n",

      "called menaquinones (vitamin K2), which have side chains based on repeating\n",

      "The biological role of vitamin K is to act as a cofactor for a speciﬁc \n",
      "carboxylation reaction that transforms selective glutamate (Glu) residues to\n",
      "g-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues (1, 2). The reaction is catalysed by a micro-\n",

      "of bile salts and the products of pancreatic lipolysis (10). In healthy adults the\n",

      "11). Within the intestinal mucosa the vitamin is incorporated into chylomi-\n",
      "crons, is secreted into the lymph, and enters the blood via the lacteals (11, 12).\n",
      "Once in the circulation, phylloquinone is rapidly cleared (10) at a \n",
      "rate consistent with its continuing association with chylomicrons and the \n",
      "chylomicron remnants, which are produced by lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis\n",
      "at the surface of capillary endothelial cells (13). After an overnight fast, more\n",

      "rich lipoproteins, with the remainder being equally distributed between \n",
      "low-density and high-density lipoproteins (13). Although phylloquinone is\n",
      "the major circulating form of vitamin K, MK-7 is also present in plasma, at\n",
      "lower concentrations and with a lipoprotein distribution similar to phyllo-\n",
      "quinone (13). Although phylloquinone in blood must have been derived\n",
      "exclusively from the diet, it is not known whether circulating menaquinones\n",

      "these sources.\n",

      "site for the vitamin. However, the discovery of vitamin K-dependent\n",
      "processes and proteins in a number of extra-hepatic tissues suggests that this\n",
      "may not be the case (see section 6.2).\n",
      "Human liver stores normally comprise about 90% menaquinones and 10%\n",

      "Zinc is present in all body tissues and ﬂuids. The total body zinc content has\n",

      "tration of zinc in lean body mass is approximately 0.46mmol/g (30mg/g).\n",
      "Plasma zinc has a rapid turnover rate and it represents only about 0.l% of total\n",

      "High concentrations of zinc are found in the choroid of the eye (4.2mmol/g\n",

      "Zinc is an essential component of a large number (>300) of enzymes \n",

      "the tissues from the lungs by red blood cell haemoglobin, as a transport\n",
      "medium for electrons within cells, and as an integrated part of important\n",
      "enzyme systems in various tissues. The physiology of iron has been exten-\n",
      "sively reviewed (1–6).\n",
      "Most of the iron in the body is present in the erythrocytes as haemoglo-\n",
      "bin, a molecule composed of four units, each containing one haem group and\n",
      "one protein chain. The structure of haemoglobin allows it to be fully loaded\n",
      "with oxygen in the lungs and partially unloaded in the tissues (e.g. in the\n",
      "muscles). The iron-containing oxygen storage protein in the muscles, myo-\n",
      "globin, is similar in structure to haemoglobin but has only one haem unit and\n",
      "one globin chain. Several iron-containing enzymes, the cytochromes, also\n",
      "have one haem group and one globin protein chain. These enzymes act as \n",
      "electron carriers within the cell and their structures do not permit reversible\n",
      "loading and unloading of oxygen. Their role in the oxidative metabolism is to\n",
      "transfer energy within the cell and speciﬁcally in the mitochondria. Other key\n",
      "functions for the iron-containing enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450) include the\n",
      "synthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids; detoxiﬁcation of foreign sub-\n",
      "stances in the liver; and signal controlling in some neurotransmitters, such as\n",
      "the dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. Iron is reversibly stored\n",

      "13.2 Iron metabolism and absorption\n",
      "13.2.1 Basal iron losses\n",
      "Iron is not actively excreted from the body in urine or in the intestines. Iron\n",
      "is only lost with cells from the skin and the interior surfaces of the body—\n",
      "intestines, urinary tract, and airways. The total amount lost is estimated at \n",
      "14mg/kg body weight/day (7). In children, it is probably more correct to relate\n",
      "these losses to body surface. A non-menstruating 55-kg woman loses about\n",
      "0.8mg Fe/day and a 70-kg man loses about 1mg/day. The range of individ-\n",

      "The newborn term infant has an iron content of about 250–300mg (75mg/kg\n",
      "body weight). During the ﬁrst 2 months of life, haemoglobin concentration\n",
      "falls because of the improved oxygen situation in the newborn infant com-\n",
      "pared with the intrauterine fetus. This leads to a considerable redistribution\n",
      "of iron from catabolized erythrocytes to iron stores. This iron will cover the\n",
      "needs of the term infant during the ﬁrst 4–6 months of life and is why iron\n",
      "requirements during this period can be provided by human milk, which con-\n",
      "tains very little iron. Because of the marked supply of iron to the fetus during\n",
      "the last trimester of pregnancy, the iron situation is much less favourable in\n",
      "the premature and low-birth-weight infant than in the healthy term infant.\n",
      "An extra supply of iron is therefore needed in these infants during the ﬁrst 6\n",
      "months of life.\n",
      "In the term infant, iron requirements rise markedly after age 4–6 months\n",
      "and amount to about 0.7–0.9mg/day during the remaining part of the ﬁrst\n",
      "year. These requirements are very high, especially in relation to body size and\n",
      "energy intake (Table 13.1) (10).\n",
      "In the ﬁrst year of life, the term infant almost doubles its total iron stores\n",
      "and triples its body weight. The increase in body iron during this period\n",
      "occurs mainly during the latter 6 months. Between 1 and 6 years of age, the\n",

The following guidelines summarized from the ADA \\nStandards of Care will address the above goals and provide guidance on nutrition therapy based on \\nnumerous scientific resources. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and other \\nstudies demonstrated the added value individualized consultation with a registered dietitian familiar \\nwith diabetes treatments, along with regular follow-up, has on long-term outcomes and is highly \\nrecommended to aid in lifestyle compliance (4). Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) implemented by a \\nregistered dietitian is associated with A1C reductions of 1.0—1.9% for people with type 1 diabetes and \\n0.3—-2.0% for people with type 2 diabetes (1). \\nTarget Guidelines For Macronutrients: The 3 Major Components Of Diet \\nMany studies have been completed to attempt to determine the optimal combination of \\nmacronutrients. Based on available data, the best mix of carbohydrate, protein, and fat depends on the \\nindividual metabolic goals and preferences of the person with diabetes. It’s most important to ensure \\nthat total energy intake is kept in mind for weight loss or maintenance (1). \\nCARBOHYDRATES \\nThe primary goal in the management of diabetes is to achieve as near normal regulation of blood \\nglucose as possible. Both the type and total amount of carbohydrate (CHO) consumed influences \\nglycemia.

Conversely, higher intakes of dietary fiber are associated with reduced \\nnon-communicable disease and premature mortality occurrence as well as improvements in body \\nweight, cholesterol concentrations, and blood pressure (6, 7). These benefits with higher fiber intakes \\nhave been observed in the general population, for those with type 1, type 2, and pre diabetes, (8) and \\nthose with hypertension or heart disease (9). With this guidance in mind, eating plans should \\nemphasize non-starchy vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, as well as dairy products with \\nminimal added sugars (1, 10). There is less consistency of evidence for recommending an amount of \\noverall CHO in the diet (1).

These two values are aligned, and higher \\nthan current World Health Organization recommendations for the general population of at least 25g \\ndietary fiber per day, (7) although all three recommendations recognize a minimum intake level, with \\ngreater benefits observed with higher intakes. These values are appreciably higher than current dietary \\nfiber intakes in the United States, which is approximately 16g per day. Our understanding of the \\nimportance of dietary fiber has changed in recent years. Dietary fiber is carbohydrate that is not \\ndigested by the stomach or absorbed in the GI tract. Instead, it is either degraded in the colon by the \\ngut microbiota, or passes through the human body intact. Higher intakes of dietary fiber are associated \\nwith lower all-cause mortality, heart disease, T2 diabetes incidence, and certain cancers such \\ncolorectal cancer when compared with lower fiber intakes (6). The benefits for childhood intakes of \\ndietary fiber and health outcomes later in life remain uncertain (12). There are several established \\nphysiological pathways that might explain these associations, such as reducing postprandial glycemia, \\ncompetitive inhibition of saturated fat in the small intestine, and greater satiety leading to reduce \\nsubsequent intake. There are also more novel pathways proposed, such as modulation of the gut \\nmicrobiota to increase branched and short chain fatty acids.

For potatoes, meta-analyses of prospective observational studies have \\nidentified the health effects are largely determined by the cooking method (17). Fried and salted \\npotatoes were associated with higher incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Boiled and \\nroasted potatoes were not associated with increased or decreased risk to health (17). Some starches \\nescape digestion, either naturally or due to food processing; these starches are called resistant \\nstarches. \\nResistant Starches \\nResistant starches are starch enclosed within intact cell walls. These include some legumes, starch \\ngranules in raw potato, retrograde amylose from plants modified to increase amylose content, or high- \\namylose containing foods, such as specially formulated cornstarch, which are not digested and \\nabsorbed as glucose. Resistant starches avoid digestion in the small intestine so do not contribute to \\npostprandial glycemia and diabetes risk, and are instead fermented in the colon by the microbiota. \\nSugars (Nutritive Sweeteners) \\nSucrose, also known as “table sugar,” is a disaccharide composed of one glucose and one fructose \\nmolecule and provides 4 kcals per gram (16). Available evidence from clinical studies does not indicate \\nthat the overall amount of dietary sucrose is related to type 2 diabetes incidence, however it is related \\nto body weight gain and increased dental caries (5). Given the association between excess body weight \\nand type 2 diabetes occurrence, (18) there is rationale to promote a reduction of sugar intake related to \\ndiabetes occurrence, and replace sugar-sweetened beverages (including fruit juices) with water or \\nno/low calorie beverages as much as possible (1).'),\n",

A two-year head- to-head trial \\ncomparing four weight loss diets with differing macronutrient content concluded that all four reduced \\nenergy diets, regardless of macronutrient content, led to comparable modest weight loss with weight \\nregain over time (62).

The concept for this list is that \\nfoods are grouped according to similar nutritional value, and can be exchanged or substituted in the \\nportion size listed within the same group. The exchange lists include: \\ne Carbohydrate group —includes starches, fruit, milk and vegetable. \\ne Meat and Meat Substitutes group —four meat categories based on the amount of fat they \\ncontain. \\ne Fat group —contains three categories of fats based on the major source of fat contained: \\nsaturated, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated. \\nThe exchange lists also give information on fiber and sodium content. They can be utilized for people \\nwith type 1 or 2 diabetes. The emphasis for type 1 is on consistency of timing and amount of food \\neaten, while for type 2, the focus is on controlling the caloric values of food consumed. Use of the \\nexchange list may be helpful for some people while others may benefit by learning from other \\ncarbohydrate counting resources available online and through numerous publications and resources. \\nCalorie Counting \\nThese are meal planning methods that can be useful for people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose \\nweight. Knowledge regarding the number of total calories in a given food (including pre-prepared and \\nfast foods) and becoming adept at label reading, can help promote weight loss when incorporated into \\nother lifestyle changes.

Learn more at LearnYourLipids.com. \\n \\nTips to Lower Your LDL Cholesterol \\nA registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) can help you make a heart-healthy meal plan that works best for your \\nlifestyle and support you in your nutrition journey. Talk with a RDN for the answers to your nutrition questions. \\nEating to Lower Your LDL-C Can be Easy \\n• Fill ½ your plate with colorful non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, kale, spinach, green beans, and carrots. \\n• Keep starchy foods ¼ of your plate. Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and fiber-rich whole wheat \\nbread. Choose healthy starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes or beans and peas. \\n• Make lean protein ¼ of your plate. Choose lean protein sources like fish, chicken and turkey with no skin, lean red \\nmeat, soy, lentils, and beans. Limit red meat, turkey, chicken, and fish or seafood to about 6 oz. to 7 oz. each day.  \\n• Have fresh fruit for dessert or a snack.    \\n• Drink 1% or nonfat milk or eat nonfat yogurt for a snack. \\nWhat can I do to lower my LDL-C? \\nHealthy eating and physical activity can help lower your LDL-C and reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. A \\nheart-healthy eating plan has lots of plant foods like legumes (cooked beans, peas and lentils), nuts, fruits and \\nvegetables, and also lean protein foods, low-fat dairy foods, and healthy fats (see ideas below).  \\nEat more foods rich in soluble fiber like beans, peas, \\nlentils, apples, oranges, pears, sweet potatoes, oats, \\noat bran, and ground flax seeds. \\nWhat is LDL-Cholesterol? \\nLDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) is the bad cholesterol that can build up in your arteries and cause a heart attack or \\nstroke. \\nReplace foods high in saturated fat with \\nfoods that contain healthy fats.  \\nUse canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower,'),\n",

This can also help you \\nachieve a healthy weight. \\nTry to exercise 150 to 300 minutes  \\neach week. You can do this by \\nwalking for 30-45 minutes 5-7 \\ndays/week. If you have not been \\nexercising at all, start with just a few \\nminutes of light activity at a time. \\n \\nLimit your cholesterol intake to  \\nless than 200 mg per day. \\nLimit egg yolks to 2-3 a week.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Purine Restricted Diet  \\n(Diet for Gout)  \\n \\n \\n \\nHaving gout can be painful.  This condition can be caused by high levels of \\nuric acid.  The excess uric acid builds up in the bloodstream in the small joints \\nor soft tissues, and causes symptoms that feel like arthritis. \\n   \\nYour body produces about 85% of uric acid in the blood stream.  Some \\npeople need to take medication to reduce the amount of uric acid the \\nbody makes.  Medication may also be needed to help your body to get rid \\nof extra uric acid. \\n   \\nSome foods in the diet contain purine, and too much purine in the diet can \\nalso increase uric acid levels.  Trying to follow a low purine diet can help \\nrelieve some of the symptoms of gout. A low protein diet is recommended for \\nindividuals with gout since most protein foods contain large amounts of \\npurine.  Some people can also benefit from a low fat diet because too much \\nfat in the diet tends to decrease the amount of uric acid your body can get \\nrid of.   \\n \\nName: \\n \\nDietitian: \\n \\nPhone number: \\n \\nDate: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAdapted from: the American Dietetic Association, Manual of Clinical Dietetics 6th Ed. 2000. \\n \\n \\nGeneral Guidelines \\n \\nWhen you are having an attack: \\n• Drink two or three litres (8-12 cups) of fluid daily, at least half should \\ncome from water. \\n• Restrict alcohol consumption or don’t drink alcohol.  Alcohol can result \\nin a build up of uric acid in the body.  If you choose to drink, do not \\ndrink more than one 4 ounce drink 3 times per week.   \\n• Follow a low purine diet (see chart).  Avoid foods on the ‘high purine’ \\nlist.  Eat foods on the ‘moderate purine’ list occasionally.  Eat foods on \\nthe low purine list daily. \\n• Eat only moderate amounts of protein (no more than 4-6 ounces per \\nday).  Eat less meat, fish and poultry.  Other good protein sources are \\ntofu and low fat milk products, low fat peanut butter and eggs. \\n• Emphasize whole grains. \\n• Limit the fats in your diet by choosing lean meats, fish, skinless poultry'),\n",

Avoid deep fried foods and high fat desserts, \\nand limit added fats like butter, margarine, oils, and salad dressing to 3-\\n6 teaspoons per day. \\n \\nBetween flare ups or chronic gout: \\n• Continue to drink at least 8 cups of fluid. \\n• Continue to limit alcohol consumption. \\n• Continue to use caution with foods on the high purine list. \\n• Maintain a healthy weight.  Try to lose weight if you need to, but weight \\nloss needs to be slow (no more than 1-2 pounds a week).  Trying to lose \\nweight too quickly can cause an attack of gout.

As a consequence, considerable research has been carried out to\\nbetter understand their physiological role and the health consequences of\\nmicronutrient-deﬁcient diets, to establish criteria for deﬁning the degree of\\npublic health severity of micronutrient malnutrition, and to develop preven-\\ntion and control strategies.\\nOne of the main outcomes of this process is greatly improved knowledge\\nof human micronutrient requirements, which is a crucial step in understand-\\ning the public health signiﬁcance of micronutrient malnutrition and identify-\\ning the most appropriate measures to prevent them. This process also led to\\nsuccessive expert consultations and publications organized jointly by the\\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World\\nHealth Organization (WHO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency\\n(IAEA) providing up-to-date knowledge and deﬁning standards for micronu-\\ntrient requirements in 19731, 19882 and in 19963.

The\\nreport should provide practical advice and recommendations which will\\nconstitute an authoritative source of information to all those from Member\\nStates who work in the areas of nutrition, agriculture, food production and\\ndistribution, and health promotion.\\n• Thirdly, the Consultation was asked to identify key issues for future\\nresearch concerning each vitamin and mineral under review and to make\\npreliminary recommendations on that research.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='preliminary recommendations on that research.\\nThe present report presents the outcome of the Consultation combined\\nwith up-to-date evidence that has since become available to answer a number\\nof issues which remained unclear or controversial at the time of the Consul-\\ntation. It was not originally thought that such an evidence-based consultation\\nprocess would be so controversial, but the reality is that there are surprisingly\\nfew data on speciﬁc health status indicators on which to base conclusions,\\nwhereas there is a great deal of information relative to overt deﬁciency disease\\nconditions. The deﬁning of human nutrient requirements and recommended\\nintakes are therefore largely based on expert interpretation and consensus on\\nthe best available scientiﬁc information.\\nWhen looking at recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) in industrialized\\ncountries over the last 25 years, it is noticeable that for some micronutrients\\nthese have gradually increased. The question is whether this is the result of\\nbetter scientiﬁc knowledge and understanding of the biochemical role of the\\nnutrients, or whether the criteria for setting requirement levels have changed,\\nor a combination of both. The scientiﬁc knowledge base has vastly expanded,\\nbut it appears that more rigorous criteria for deﬁning recommended levels is\\nalso a key factor.\\nRNIs for vitamins and minerals were initially established on the under-\\nstanding that they are meant to meet the basic nutritional needs of over 97%\\nof the population. However, a fundamental criterion in industrialized coun-\\ntries has become one of the presumptive role that these nutrients play in “pre-\\nventing” an increasing range of disease conditions that characterize affected\\npopulations. The latter approach implies trying to deﬁne the notion of\\n“optimal nutrition”, and this has been one of the factors nudging deﬁned\\nrequirements to still higher levels.\\nThis shift in the goal for setting RNIs is not without reason. The popula-'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='This shift in the goal for setting RNIs is not without reason. The popula-\\ntions that are targeted for prevention through “optimal nutrition” are char-\\nacterized by sedentary lifestyles and longer life expectancy. The populations\\nin industrialized countries are ageing, and concern for the health of the older\\nperson has grown accordingly. In contrast, the micronutrient needs of popu-\\nlation groups in developing countries are still viewed in terms of millions\\nexperiencing deﬁciency, and are then more appropriately deﬁned as those that\\nwill satisfy basic nutritional needs of physically active younger populations.\\nNevertheless, one also needs to bear in mind the double burden of under- and\\novernutrition, which is growing rapidly in many developing countries.\\nConcern has been raised about possible differences in micronutrient needs\\nof populations with different lifestyles for a very practical reason. The logic\\nbehind the establishment of micronutrient needs of industrialized nations has\\ncome about at the same time as a large and growing demand for a wide variety\\nof supplements and fortiﬁcants, and manufacturers have responded quickly\\nto meet this market. This phenomenon could easily skew national strategies\\nfor nutritional development, with an increased tendency to seek to resolve the\\nmicronutrient deﬁciency problems of developing countries by promoting\\nsupplements and fortiﬁcation strategies, rather than through increasing the\\nconsumption of adequate and varied diets. Higher levels of RNIs often set in\\ndeveloped countries can easily be supported because they can be met with\\nsupplementation in addition to food which itself is often fortiﬁed. In contrast,\\nit often becomes difﬁcult to meet some of the micronutrient needs in some\\npopulations of developing countries by consuming locally available food,\\nbecause foods are often seasonal, and neither supplementation nor fortiﬁca-\\ntion reach vulnerable population groups.'),\n",

Concepts, definitions and approaches\\nused to define nutritional needs and\\nrecommendations\\n1\\n1.1 Introduction\\nThe dietary requirement for a micronutrient is deﬁned as an intake level which\\nmeets a speciﬁed criteria for adequacy, thereby minimizing risk of nutrient\\ndeﬁcit or excess. These criteria cover a gradient of biological effects related to\\na range of nutrient intakes which, at the extremes, include the intake required\\nto prevent death associated with nutrient deﬁcit or excess. However, for nutri-\\nents where insufﬁcient data on mortality are available, which is the case for\\nmost micronutrients discussed in this report, other biological responses must\\nbe deﬁned. These include clinical disease as determined by signs and symp-\\ntoms of nutrient deﬁciency, and subclinical conditions identiﬁed by speciﬁc'),\n",

Measures of nutrient stores or critical\\ntissue pools may also be used to determine nutrient adequacy.\\nFunctional assays are presently the most relevant indices of subclinical con-\\nditions related to vitamin and mineral intakes. Ideally, these biomarkers\\nshould be sensitive to changes in nutritional state while at the same time be\\nspeciﬁc to the nutrient responsible for the subclinical deﬁciency. Often, the\\nmost sensitive indicators are not the most speciﬁc; for example, plasma fer-\\nritin, a sensitive indicator of iron status, may change not only in response to\\niron supply, but also as a result of acute infection or chronic inﬂammatory\\nprocesses. Similarly anaemia, the deﬁning marker of dietary iron deﬁciency,\\nmay also result from, among other things, deﬁciencies in folate, vitamin B12\\nor copper.\\nThe choice of criteria used to deﬁne requirements is of critical importance,\\nsince the recommended nutrient intake to meet the deﬁned requirement will\\nclearly vary, depending, among other factors, on the criterion used to deﬁne\\nnutrient adequacy (1, 2, 3). Unfortunately, the information base to scientiﬁ-\\ncally support the deﬁnition of nutritional needs across age ranges, sex and\\nphysiologic states is limited for many nutrients. Where relevant and possible,\\nrequirement estimates presented here include an allowance for variations in\\nmicronutrient bioavailability and utilization. The use of nutrient balance to\\ndeﬁne requirements has been avoided whenever possible, since it is now \\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n2\\ngenerally recognized that balance can be reached over a wide range of nutri-\\nent intakes.

It is based on a given criteria of adequacy which will vary\\ndepending on the speciﬁed nutrient. Therefore, estimation of requirement\\nstarts by stating the criteria that will be used to deﬁne adequacy and then\\nestablishing the necessary corrections for physiological and dietary factors.\\nOnce a mean requirement value is obtained from a group of subjects, the\\nnutrient intake is adjusted for interindividual variability to arrive at a \\nrecommendation (4, 5, 6).\\n1.2.2 Recommended nutrient intake\\nRecommended nutrient intake (RNI) is the daily intake, set at the EAR plus\\n2 standard deviations (SD), which meets the nutrient requirements of almost\\nall apparently healthy individuals in an age- and sex-speciﬁc population\\ngroup. If the distribution of requirement values is not known, a Gaussian or\\nnormal distribution can be assumed, and from this it is expected that the mean\\nrequirement plus 2 SD will cover the nutrient needs of 97.5% of the popula-\\ntion. If the SD is not known, a value based on each nutrient’s physiology can\\nbe used and in most cases a variation in the range of 10–12.5% can be assumed\\n(exceptions are noted within relevant chapters).

This has recently been recognized by the WHO\\nInternational Programme on Chemical Safety, and a special risk assessment\\nmodel has been derived for elements that are both essential and have poten-\\ntial toxicity (5, 9).\\n1.2.7 Use of nutrient intake recommendations in population\\nassessment\\nRecommendations given in this report are generally presented as population\\nRNIs with a corresponding UL where appropriate. They are not intended to\\ndeﬁne the daily requirements of an individual. However “healthy” individu-\\nals consuming within the range of the RNI and the UL can expect to mini-\\nmize their risk of micronutrient deﬁcit and excess.

It assumes that the variability of individual intakes is at least\\nas large as the variability in requirements and that the distribution of intakes\\nand requirements are independent of each other. The latter is most likely to\\nbe true in the case of vitamins and minerals, but clearly not for energy. The\\nEAR cut-point method requires a single population with a symmetrical dis-\\ntribution around the mean. If these conditions are met, the prevalence of inad-\\nequate intakes corresponds to the proportion of intakes that fall below the\\nEAR. It is clearly inappropriate to examine mean values of population intake\\nand RNI to deﬁne the population at risk of inadequacy. The relevant infor-\\nmation is the proportion of intakes in a population group that is below the\\nEAR, not below the RNI (4, 5).\\nFigure 1.2 serves to illustrate the use of nutrient intake recommendations\\nin risk assessment considering the model presented in Figure 1.1; the distribu-\\ntions of nutrient intakes for a population have been added to explore risk of\\nexcess or deﬁcit (2, 4, 5). Figure 1.2a presents the case of a single population\\nwith intakes ranging from below the EAR to the UL with a mean intake close\\nto the RNI. The fraction of the population that is below the EAR represents\\nthe prevalence of deﬁcit; as depicted in the ﬁgure this is a sizeable group despite\\nthe fact that the mean intake for the population is close to the RNI.

However, in most cases,\\nbalance based on input–output measurements is greatly inﬂuenced by prior\\nlevel of intake, that is, subjects adjust to high intakes by increasing output\\nand, conversely, they lower output when intake is low. Thus, if sufﬁcient time\\nis provided to accommodate to a given level of intake, balance can be achieved,\\nand for this reason, the exclusive use of nutrient balance to deﬁne require-\\nments should be avoided whenever possible (1, 5, 13).\\nIn the absence of alternative sources of data, a starting point in deﬁning\\nnutritional requirements using the balance methodology is the use of facto-\\nrial estimates of nutritional need. The “factorial model” is based on measur-\\ning the components that must be replaced when the intake of a speciﬁc\\nnutrient is minimal or nil. This is the minimum possible requirement value\\nand encompasses a) replacement of losses from excretion and utilization at\\nlow or no intake, b) the need to maintain body stores and, c) an intake that\\nis usually sufﬁcient to prevent clinical deﬁciency (6).

Indeed, the presently recommended nutrient intakes for term\\ninfants of several vitamins and minerals are based on this paradigm. Thus, the\\nnutrient intake of the breast-fed infant becomes the relevant criteria since it\\nis assumed that human milk is the optimal food for human growth and devel-\\nopment. In this case, all other criteria are subservient to the estimate obtained\\nfrom assessment of the range of documented intake observed in the full term\\nbreast-fed infant. Precise knowledge of human milk composition and volume\\nof intake for postnatal age allows for the deﬁnition of the range of intakes\\ntypical for breast-fed infants. A notable exception, however, is the require-\\nment for vitamin K at birth, since breast milk contains little vitamin K, \\nand the sterile colon does not provide the vitamin K formed by colonic\\nmicroorganisms.\\nPlanners using RNIs are often faced with different, sometimes conﬂicting\\nnumbers, recommended by respectable national scientiﬁc bodies that have\\nused varying approaches to deﬁne them (31, 32).

Vitamin A\\n17\\n2.1 Role of vitamin A in human metabolic processes\\nVitamin A (retinol) is an essential nutrient needed in small amounts by\\nhumans for the normal functioning of the visual system; growth and devel-\\nopment; and maintenance of epithelial cellular integrity, immune function,\\nand reproduction. These dietary needs for vitamin A are normally provided\\nfor as preformed retinol (mainly as retinyl ester) and provitamin A\\ncarotenoids.\\n2.1.1 Overview of vitamin A metabolism\\nPreformed vitamin A in animal foods occurs as retinyl esters of fatty acids in\\nassociation with membrane-bound cellular lipid and fat-containing storage'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='association with membrane-bound cellular lipid and fat-containing storage\\ncells. Provitamin A carotenoids in foods of vegetable origin are also associ-\\nated with cellular lipids but are embedded in complex cellular structures such\\nas the cellulose-containing matrix of chloroplasts or the pigment-containing\\nportion of chromoplasts. Normal digestive processes free vitamin A and\\ncarotenoids from food matrices, which is a more efﬁcient process from animal\\nthan from vegetable tissues. Retinyl esters are hydrolysed and the retinol \\nand freed carotenoids are incorporated into lipid-containing, water-miscible\\nmicellar solutions. Products of fat digestion (e.g. fatty acids, monoglycerides,\\ncholesterol, and phospholipids) and secretions in bile (e.g. bile salts and\\nhydrolytic enzymes) are essential for the efﬁcient solubilization of retinol and\\nespecially for solubilization of the very lipophilic carotenoids (e.g. a- and b-\\ncarotene, b-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene) in the aqueous intestinal milieu.\\nMicellar solubilization is a prerequisite to their efﬁcient passage into the lipid-\\nrich membrane of intestinal mucosal cells (i.e. enterocytes) (1–3). Diets criti-\\ncally low in dietary fat (under about 5–10g daily) (4) or disease conditions\\nthat interfere with normal digestion and absorption leading to steatorrhoea\\n(e.g. pancreatic and liver diseases and frequent gastroenteritis) can therefore\\nimpede the efﬁcient absorption of retinol and carotenoids. Retinol and some\\ncarotenoids enter the intestinal mucosal brush border by diffusion in accord\\nwith the concentration gradient between the micelle and plasma membrane of\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n18\\nenterocytes. Some carotenoids pass into the enterocyte and are solubilized\\ninto chylomicrons without further change whereas some of the provitamin A\\ncarotenoids are converted to retinol by a cleavage enzyme in the brush border\\n(3).

Retinyl esters and unconverted\\ncarotenoids together with other lipids are incorporated into chylomicrons,\\nexcreted into intestinal lymphatic channels, and delivered to the blood\\nthrough the thoracic duct (2).\\nTissues extract most lipids and some carotenoids from circulating chy-\\nlomicrons, but most retinyl esters are stripped from the chylomicron remnant,\\nhydrolysed, and taken up primarily by parenchymal liver cells. If not imme-\\ndiately needed, retinol is re-esteriﬁed and retained in the fat-storing cells \\nof the liver (variously called adipocytes, stellate cells, or Ito cells). The liver\\nparenchymal cells also take in substantial amounts of carotenoids. Whereas\\nmost of the body’s vitamin A reserve remains in the liver, carotenoids are \\nalso deposited elsewhere in fatty tissues throughout the body (1). Usually,\\nturnover of carotenoids in tissues is relatively slow, but in times of low dietary\\ncarotenoid intake, stored carotenoids are mobilized. A recent study in one\\nsubject using stable isotopes suggests that retinol can be derived not only from\\nconversion of dietary provitamin carotenoids in enterocytes—the major site\\nof bioconversion—but also from hepatic conversion of circulating provitamin\\ncarotenoids (5). The quantitative contribution to vitamin A requirements of\\ncarotenoid converted to retinoids beyond the enterocyte is unknown.\\nFollowing hydrolysis of stored retinyl esters, retinol combines with \\na plasma-speciﬁc transport protein, retinol-binding protein (RBP). This\\nprocess, including synthesis of the unoccupied RBP (apo-RBP), occurs to the\\ngreatest extent within liver cells but it may also occur in some peripheral\\ntissues.

Dietary restriction in energy, proteins, and some\\nmicronutrients can limit hepatic synthesis of proteins speciﬁc to mobilization\\nand transport of vitamin A. Altered kidney functions or fever associated with\\ninfections (e.g. respiratory infections (6) or diarrhoea [7]) can increase urinary\\nvitamin A loss.\\nHolo-RBP transiently associates with target tissue membranes, and spe-\\nciﬁc intracellular binding proteins then extract the retinol. Some of the tran-\\nsiently sequestered retinol is released into the blood unchanged and is recycled\\n(i.e. conserved) (1, 8). A limited reserve of intracellular retinyl esters is formed\\nthat subsequently can provide functionally active retinol and its oxidation\\nproducts (i.e. isomers of retinoic acid) as needed intracellularly. These bio-\\nlogically active forms of vitamin A are associated with speciﬁc cellular \\nproteins which bind with retinoids within cells during metabolism and with\\nnuclear receptors that mediate retinoid action on the genome (9). Retinoids\\nmodulate the transcription of several hundreds of genes (10–12).

In the visual system, carrier-\\nbound retinol is transported to ocular tissue and to the retina by intracellu-\\nlar binding and transport proteins. Rhodopsin, the visual pigment critical to\\ndim-light vision, is formed in rod cells after conversion of all-trans-retinol to\\nretinaldehyde, isomerization to the 11-cis-form, and binding to opsin. Alter-\\nation of rhodopsin through a cascade of photochemical reactions results in\\nthe ability to see objects in dim light (13). The speed at which rhodopsin is\\nregenerated is related to the availability of retinol. Night blindness is usually\\nan indicator of inadequate available retinol, but it can also be due to a deﬁcit\\nof other nutrients that are critical to the regeneration of rhodopsin, such as\\nprotein and zinc, and to some inherited diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.\\nThe growth and differentiation of epithelial cells throughout the body are\\nespecially affected by vitamin A deﬁciency (VAD). In addition, goblet cell\\nnumbers are reduced in epithelial tissues and as a consequence, mucous secre-\\ntions (with their antimicrobial components) diminish. Cells lining protective\\ntissue surfaces fail to regenerate and differentiate, hence they ﬂatten and accu-\\nmulate keratin. Both factors—the decline in mucous secretions and loss of cel-\\nlular integrity—reduce the body’s ability to resist invasion from potentially\\npathogenic organisms. Pathogens can also compromise the immune system\\nby directly interfering with the production of some types of protective secre-\\n2.

This\\nperiod of life is characterized by high requirements for vitamin A to support\\nrapid growth, and the transition from breastfeeding to dependence on other\\ndietary sources of the vitamin. In addition, adequate intake of vitamin A\\nreduces the risk of catching respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. The\\nincreased mortality risk from concurrent infections extends at least to 6 years\\nof age and is associated with both clinical and subclinical VAD (20).

Periods of general\\nfood shortage (and speciﬁc shortages in vitamin A-rich foods) coincide with\\npeak incidence of VAD and common childhood infectious diseases (e.g. diar-\\nrhoea, respiratory infections, and measles). Seasonal food availability inﬂu-\\nences VAD prevalence directly by inﬂuencing access to provitamin A sources;\\nfor example, the scarcity of mangoes in hot arid months followed by the glut-\\nting of the market with mangoes during harvest seasons (30). Seasonal growth\\nspurts in children, which frequently follow seasonal post-harvest increases in\\nenergy and macronutrient intakes, can also affect the balance. These increases\\nare usually obtained from staple grains (e.g. rice) and tubers (e.g. light-\\ncoloured yams) that are not, however, good sources of some micronutrients\\n(e.g. vitamin A) to support the growth spurt (31).\\nFood habits and taboos often restrict consumption of potentially good\\nfood sources of vitamin A (e.g. mangoes and green leafy vegetables).

Moreover, the incidence (37) and prevalence (38) of diarrhoea may\\nalso increase with subclinical VAD. Meta-analyses conducted by three inde-\\npendent groups using data from several randomized trials provide convinc-\\ning evidence that community-based improvement of the vitamin A status of\\ndeﬁcient children aged 6 months to 6 years reduces their risk of dying by\\n20–30% on average (20, 39, 40).

It was recognized at the\\ntime that the recommended conversion factors (i.e. 1:6 for vitamin A:b-\\ncarotene and 1:12 for vitamin A:all other provitamin carotenoids) were only\\nbest approximations for a mixed diet, which could under- or overestimate\\nbioavailability depending not only on the quantity and source of carotenoids\\nin the diet, but also on how the foods were processed and served (e.g. cooked\\nor raw, whole or puréed, with or without fat). In 1988, a Joint FAO/WHO\\nExpert Consultation (62) conﬁrmed these conversion factors for operational\\napplication in evaluating mixed diets. In reaching its conclusion, the Consul-\\ntation noted the controlled depletion–repletion studies in adult men using a\\ndark adaptation endpoint that reported a 2:1 equivalency of supplemental b-\\ncarotene to retinol (63), and the range of factors that could alter the equiva-\\nlency ratio when dietary carotenoids replaced supplements.\\nRecently there has been renewed interest in re-examining conventional\\nconversion factors by using more quantitative stable isotope techniques for\\nmeasuring whole-body stores in response to controlled intakes (64–66) and\\nby following post-absorption carotenoids in the triacylglycerol-rich lipopro-\\ntein fraction (67–70).

Foods containing provitamin A carotenoids tend to\\nhave less biologically available vitamin A but are more affordable than animal\\nproducts.

During at least the ﬁrst 6 months of life, exclusive\\nbreastfeeding can provide sufﬁcient vitamin A to maintain health, permit\\nnormal growth, and maintain sufﬁcient stores in the liver (104).\\nReported retinol concentrations in human milk vary widely from country\\nto country (0.70–2.45mmol/l). In some developing countries, the vitamin A\\nintake of breast-fed infants who grow well and do not show signs of deﬁ-\\nciency ranges from 120 to 170mg RE/day (25, 104). Such intakes are consid-\\nered adequate to cover infant requirements if the infant’s weight is assumed\\nto be at least at the 10th percentile according to WHO standards (62).\\nHowever, this intake is unlikely to build adequate body stores, given that\\nxerophthalmia is common in preschool-age children in the same communi-\\nties with somewhat lower intakes. Because of the need for vitamin A to\\nsupport the growth rate of infancy, which can vary considerably, a require-\\nment estimate of 180mg RE/day seems appropriate.\\nThe safe level for infants up to 6 months of age is based on observations\\nof breast-fed infants in communities in which good nutrition is the norm.\\nAverage consumption of human milk by such infants is about 750ml/day\\nduring the ﬁrst 6 months (104). Assuming an average concentration of vitamin\\nA in human milk of about 1.75mmol/l, the mean daily intake would be about\\n375mg RE, which is therefore the recommended safe level. From 7–12 months,\\nhuman milk intake averages 650ml/day, which would provide 325mg of\\nvitamin A daily.

In\\npoor communities where children 1–6 years old are reported to have intakes\\nof about 100–200mg RE/day, signs of VAD do occur; in southern India these\\nsigns were relieved and risk of mortality was reduced when the equivalent of\\n350–400mg RE/day was given to children weekly (105). In the United States,\\nmost preschool-age children maintain serum retinol levels of 0.70mmol/l or\\nhigher while consuming diets providing 300–400mg RE/day (from the data-\\nbank for the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\\n[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm]).\\n2.6.2 Adults\\nEstimates for the requirements and recommended safe intakes for adults are\\nalso extrapolated from those derived for late infancy, i.e. 4.8 and 9.3mg RE/kg\\nbody weight/day (62).

Vitamin D\\n45\\n3.1 Role of vitamin D in human metabolic processes\\nVitamin D is required to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phos-\\nphate, which are in turn needed for the normal mineralization of bone, muscle\\ncontraction, nerve conduction, and general cellular function in all cells of the\\nbody. Vitamin D achieves this after its conversion to the active form 1,25-\\ndihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], or calcitriol. This active form regulates\\nthe transcription of a number of vitamin D-dependent genes which code for\\ncalcium-transporting proteins and bone matrix proteins.\\nVitamin D also modulates the transcription of cell cycle proteins, which\\ndecrease cell proliferation and increase cell differentiation of a number of spe-\\ncialized cells of the body (e.g. osteoclastic precursors, enterocytes, ker-\\natinocytes). This property may explain the actions of vitamin D in bone\\nresorption, intestinal calcium transport, and skin. Vitamin D also possesses\\nimmunomodulatory properties that may alter responses to infections in vivo.\\nThese cell differentiating and immunomodulatory properties underlie the\\nreason why vitamin D derivatives are now used successfully in the treatment'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='reason why vitamin D derivatives are now used successfully in the treatment\\nof psoriasis and other skin disorders.\\n3.1.1 Overview of vitamin D metabolism\\nVitamin D, a seco-steroid, can either be made in the skin from a cholesterol-\\nlike precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) by exposure to sunlight or can be pro-\\nvided pre-formed in the diet (1). The version made in the skin is referred to\\nas vitamin D3 whereas the dietary form can be vitamin D3 or a closely-related\\nmolecule of plant origin known as vitamin D2 . Because vitamin D can be made\\nin the skin, it should not strictly be called a vitamin, and some nutritional\\ntexts refer to the substance as a prohormone and to the two forms as cole-\\ncalciferol (D3) and ergocalciferol (D2).\\nFrom a nutritional perspective, the two forms are metabolized similarly \\nin humans, are equal in potency, and can be considered equivalent. It is \\nnow ﬁrmly established that vitamin D3 is metabolized ﬁrst in the liver to \\n25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) (2) and subsequently in the kidneys to \\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n46\\n1,25-(OH)2D (calcitriol) (3) to produce a biologically active hormone. The\\n1,25-(OH)2D compound, like all vitamin D metabolites, is present in the\\nblood complexed to the vitamin D-binding protein, a speciﬁc a-globulin. Cal-\\ncitriol is believed to act on target cells in a similar way to a steroid hormone.\\nFree hormone crosses the plasma membrane and interacts with a speciﬁc\\nnuclear receptor known as the vitamin D receptor, a DNA-binding, zinc-\\nﬁnger protein with a relative molecular mass of 55000 (4). This ligand-recep-\\ntor complex binds to a speciﬁc vitamin D-responsive element and, with\\nassociated transcription factors (e.g. retinoid X receptor), enhances transcrip-\\ntion of mRNAs which code for calcium-transporting proteins, bone matrix\\nproteins, or cell cycle-regulating proteins (5). As a result of these processes,\\n1,25-(OH)2D stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='1,25-(OH)2D stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and\\nmobilizes calcium and phosphate by stimulating bone resorption (6). These\\nfunctions serve the common purpose of restoring blood levels of calcium and\\nphosphate to normal when concentrations of the two ions are low.\\nLately, interest has focused on other cellular actions of calcitriol. With the\\ndiscovery of 1,25-(OH)2D receptors in many classically non-target tissues\\nsuch as brain, various bone marrow-derived cells, skin, and thymus (7), the\\nview has been expressed that 1,25-(OH)2D induces fusion and differentiation\\nof macrophages (8, 9). This effect has been widely interpreted to mean that\\nthe natural role of 1,25-(OH)2D is to induce osteoclastogenesis from colony\\nforming units (i.e. granulatory monocytes in the bone marrow). Calcitriol also\\nsuppresses interleukin-2 production in activated T-lymphocytes (10, 11), an\\neffect which suggests the hormone might play a role in immuno-\\nmodulation in vivo. Other tissues (e.g. skin) are directly affected by exoge-\\nnous administration of vitamin D, though the physiologic signiﬁcance of these\\neffects is poorly understood. The pharmacologic effects of 1,25-(OH)2D are\\nprofound and have resulted in the development of vitamin D analogues, which\\nare approved for use in hyperproliferative conditions such as psoriasis (12).\\nClinical assays measure 1,25-(OH)2D2 and 1,25-(OH)2D3, collectively\\ncalled 1,25-(OH)2D. Similarly, calcidiol is measured as 25-OH-D but it is a\\nmixture of 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3. For the purposes of this document,\\n1,25-(OH)2D and 25-OH-D will be used to refer to calcitriol and calcidiol,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1.2 Calcium homeostasis\\nIn calcium homeostasis, 1,25-(OH)2D works in conjunction with parathyroid\\nhormone (PTH) to produce its beneﬁcial effects on the plasma levels of\\nionized calcium and phosphate (5, 13). The physiologic loop (Figure 3.1) starts\\nwith the calcium receptor of the parathyroid gland (14). When the level of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='with the calcium receptor of the parathyroid gland (14). When the level of\\nionized calcium in plasma falls, PTH is secreted by the parathyroid gland and\\nstimulates the tightly regulated renal enzyme 25-OH-D-1-a-hydroxylase to\\nmake more 1,25-(OH)2D from the large circulating pool of 25-OH-D. The\\nresulting increase in 1,25-(OH)2D (with the rise in PTH) causes an increase\\nin calcium transport within the intestine, bone, and kidney. All these events\\nraise plasma calcium levels back to normal, which in turn is sensed by the\\ncalcium receptor of the parathyroid gland. The further secretion of PTH is\\nturned off not only by the feedback action of calcium, but also by a short\\nfeedback loop involving 1,25-(OH)2D directly suppressing PTH synthesis in\\nthe parathyroid gland (not shown in Figure 3.1).\\nAlthough this model oversimpliﬁes the events involved in calcium home-\\nostasis, it clearly demonstrates that sufﬁcient 25-OH-D must be available \\nto provide adequate 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis and hence an adequate level \\nof plasma calcium; and similarly that vitamin D deﬁciency will result in \\ninadequate 25-OH-D and 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis, inadequate calcium \\nhomeostasis, and a constantly elevated PTH level (i.e. secondary \\nhyperparathyroidism).\\nIt becomes evident from this method of presentation of the role of vitamin\\nD that the nutritionist can focus on the plasma levels of 25-OH-D and PTH\\nto gain an insight into vitamin D status. Not shown but also important is \\nthe end-point of the physiologic action of vitamin D, namely, adequate \\nplasma calcium and phosphate ions that provide the raw materials for bone\\nmineralization.\\n3.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='48\\n3.2 Populations at risk for vitamin D deficiency\\n3.2.1 Infants\\nInfants constitute a population at risk for vitamin D deﬁciency because of rel-\\natively large vitamin D needs brought about by their high rate of skeletal\\ngrowth. At birth, infants have acquired in utero the vitamin D stores that must\\ncarry them through the ﬁrst months of life. A recent survey of French\\nneonates revealed that 64% had 25-OH-D values below 30nmol/l, the lower\\nlimit of the normal range (15). Breast-fed infants are particularly at risk\\nbecause of the low concentrations of vitamin D in human milk (16). This\\nproblem is further compounded in some infants fed human milk by a restric-\\ntion in exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light for seasonal, latitudinal, cultural, or\\nsocial reasons. Infants born in the autumn months at extreme latitudes are\\nparticularly at risk because they spend the ﬁrst 6 months of their life indoors\\nand therefore have little opportunity to synthesize vitamin D in their skin\\nduring this period. Consequently, although vitamin D deﬁciency is rare in\\ndeveloped countries, sporadic cases of rickets are still being reported in many\\nnorthern cities but almost always in infants fed human milk (17–20).\\nInfant formulas are supplemented with vitamin D at levels ranging from 40\\ninternational units (IU) or 1mg/418.4kJ to 100IU or 2.5mg/418.4kJ, that\\nprovide approximately between 6mg and 15mg of vitamin D, respectively.\\nThese amounts of dietary vitamin D are sufﬁcient to prevent rickets.\\n3.2.2 Adolescents\\nAnother period of rapid growth of the skeleton occurs at puberty and\\nincreases the need not for the vitamin D itself, but for the active form 1,25-\\n(OH)2D. This need results from the increased conversion of 25-OH-D to\\n1,25-(OH)2D in adolescents (21). Unlike infants, however, adolescents usually\\nspend more time outdoors and therefore usually are exposed to levels of UV\\nlight sufﬁcient for synthesizing vitamin D for their needs. Excess production'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='light sufﬁcient for synthesizing vitamin D for their needs. Excess production\\nof vitamin D in the summer and early autumn months is stored mainly in the\\nadipose tissue (22) and is available to sustain high growth rates in the winter\\nmonths that follow. Insufﬁcient vitamin D stores during this period of\\nincreased growth can lead to vitamin D insufﬁciency (23).\\n3.2.3 Elderly\\nOver the past 20 years, clinical research studies of the basic biochemical\\nmachinery for handling vitamin D have suggested an age-related decline in \\nmany key steps of vitamin D action (24), including the rate of skin synthesis,\\nthe rate of hydroxylation (leading to the activation to the hormonal form),\\nand the response of target tissues (e.g. bone) (25). Not surprisingly, a number\\nof independent studies from around the world have shown that there appears\\nto be vitamin D deﬁciency in a subset of the elderly population, character-\\nized by low blood levels of 25-OH-D coupled with elevations in plasma PTH\\nand alkaline phosphatase (26). There is evidence that this vitamin D deﬁciency\\ncontributes to declining bone mass and increases the incidence of hip frac-\\ntures (27). Although some of these studies may exaggerate the extent of the\\nproblem by focusing on institutionalized individuals or inpatients with\\ndecreased sun exposures, in general they have forced health professionals to\\nre-address the vitamin D intake of this segment of society and look at poten-\\ntial solutions to correct the problem. Table 3.1 presents the ﬁndings of several\\nstudies that found that modest increases in vitamin D intakes (between 10 and\\n20mg/day) reduce the rate of bone loss and the incidence of hip fractures.\\nThese ﬁndings have led several agencies and researchers to suggest an\\nincrease in recommended vitamin D intakes for the elderly from 2.5–\\n5mg/day to a value that is able to maintain normal 25-OH-D levels in the\\nelderly, such as 10–15mg/day.

This vitamin D intake results in lower rates of\\nbone loss and is proposed for the middle-aged (50–70 years) and old-aged \\n(>70 years) populations (33). The increased requirements are justiﬁed mainly\\non the grounds of the reduction in skin synthesis of vitamin D, a linear reduc-\\ntion occurring in both men and women that begins with the thinning of the\\nskin at age 20 years (24).\\n3.2.4 Pregnant and lactating women\\nElucidation of the changes in calciotropic hormones occurring during preg-\\nnancy and lactation has revealed a role for vitamin D in the former but not\\ndeﬁnitively in the latter. Even in pregnancy, the changes in vitamin D metab-\\nolism which occur, namely an increase in the maternal plasma levels of 1,25-\\n(OH)2D (34) due to a putative placental synthesis of the hormone (35), do not\\nseem to impinge greatly on the maternal vitamin D requirements. The concern\\nthat modest vitamin D supplementation might be deleterious to the fetus is\\nnot justiﬁed. Furthermore, because transfer of vitamin D from mother to fetus\\nis important for establishing the neonate’s growth rate, the goal of ensuring\\nadequate vitamin D status with conventional prenatal vitamin D supplements\\nprobably should not be discouraged.\\nIn lactating women there appears to be no direct role for vitamin D because\\nincreased calcium needs are regulated by the PTH-related peptide (36, 37),\\nand recent studies have failed to show any change in vitamin D metabolites\\nduring lactation (38, 39).

Because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D, rare cases of\\nnutritional rickets are still found, but these are almost always in breast-fed\\ninfants deprived of sunlight exposure (17–20). Furthermore, there is little evi-\\ndence that increasing calcium or vitamin D supplementation to lactating\\nmothers results in an increased transfer of calcium or vitamin D in milk (38).\\nThus, the current thinking, based on a clearer understanding of the role of\\nvitamin D in lactation, is that there is little purpose in recommending addi-'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='vitamin D in lactation, is that there is little purpose in recommending addi-\\ntional vitamin D for lactating women. The goal for mothers who breastfeed\\ntheir infants seems to be merely to ensure good nutrition and sunshine expo-\\nsure in order to ensure normal vitamin D status during the perinatal period.\\n3.3 Evidence used for estimating recommended \\nintakes\\n3.3.1 Lack of accuracy in estimating dietary intake and \\nskin synthesis\\nThe unique problem of estimating total intake of a substance that can be pro-\\nvided in the diet or made in the skin by exposure to sunlight makes it difﬁ-\\ncult to derive adequate total intakes of vitamin D for the general population.\\nMoreover, accurate food composition data are not available for vitamin D,\\naccentuating the difﬁculty in estimating dietary intakes. Whereas two recent\\nUnited States national surveys have avoided even attempting this task, the\\nsecond National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II)\\nestimated vitamin D intakes to be 2.9mg/day and 2.3mg/day for younger and\\nolder women, respectively. A recent study of elderly women by Kinyamu et\\nal. (40) concurred with this assessment, ﬁnding an intake of 3.53mg/day.\\nSkin synthesis is equally difﬁcult to estimate, being affected by such impon-\\nderables as age, season, latitude, time of day, skin exposure, and sunscreen use.\\nIn vitamin D-replete individuals, estimates of skin synthesis are put at around\\n10mg/day (24, 41), with total intakes estimated at 15mg/day (24).\\n3.3.2 Use of plasma 25-OH-D as a measure of vitamin D status\\nNumerous recent studies have used plasma 25-OH-D as a measure of vitamin\\nD status, and there is a strong presumptive relationship of this variable with\\nbone status. Thus, it is not surprising that several nutritional committees (e.g.\\nthe Food and Nutrition Board of the United States National Academy of Sci-\\nences’ Institute of Medicine in conjunction with Health Canada) have chosen'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='ences’ Institute of Medicine in conjunction with Health Canada) have chosen\\nto use a biochemical basis for estimating required intakes and have used these\\nestimates to derive recommended intakes (33). The method used involves the\\n3. VITAMIN D\\n51\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n52\\nestimation of the mean group dietary intake of vitamin D required to main-\\ntain the plasma 25-OH-D levels above 27nmol/l, which is the level necessary\\nto ensure normal bone health. Previously, many studies had established \\n27nmol/l as the lower limit of the normal range (e.g. NHANES III [42]). This\\ndietary intake of vitamin D for each population group was rounded to the\\nnearest 50IU (1.25mg) and then doubled to cover the needs of all individuals\\nwithin that group irrespective of sunlight exposure. This amount was termed\\nadequate intake (AI) and was used in place of the recommended dietary\\nallowance (RDA), which had been used by United States agencies since 1941.\\nThe present Expert Consultation decided to use these ﬁgures as recommended\\nnutrient intakes (RNIs) because it considered this to be an entirely logical\\napproach to estimating the vitamin D needs for the global population.\\nBecause many studies had recommended increases in vitamin D intakes for\\nthe elderly, it might have been expected that the proposed increases in sug-\\ngested intakes from 5mg/day (the RDA in the United States [43] and the RNI\\nin Canada [44]) to between 10 and 15mg/day (AI) would be welcomed.\\nHowever, a recent editorial in a prominent medical journal attacked the rec-\\nommendations as being too conservative (45). Furthermore, an article in the\\nsame journal (46) reported the level of hypovitaminosis D to be as high as\\n57% in a population of ageing (mean age, 62 years) medical inpatients in the\\nBoston area.\\nOf course, such inpatients are by deﬁnition sick and should not be used to\\ncalculate intakes of healthy individuals.

Indeed, the new NHANES III study\\n(42) of 18323 healthy individuals from all regions of the United States \\nsuggests that approximately 5% had values of 25-OH-D below 27nmol/l (see\\nTable 3.2). Although the data are skewed by sampling biases that favour\\nsample collection in the southern states in winter months and northern states\\nin the summer months, even subsets of data collected in northern states \\nin September give the incidence of low 25-OH-D in the elderly in the \\n6–18% range (47), compared with 57% in the institutionalized inpatient \\npopulation (46) mentioned above. Ideally, such measurements in a healthy\\npopulation should be made at the end of the winter months before UV irra-\\ndiation has reached a strength sufﬁcient to allow skin synthesis of vitamin D.\\nThus, the NHANES III study may still underestimate the incidence of\\nhypovitaminosis D in a northern elderly population in winter. Nevertheless,\\nin lieu of additional studies of selected human populations, it would seem \\nthat the recommendations of the Food and Nutrition Board are reasonable\\nguidelines for vitamin D intakes, at least for the near future. This considered\\napproach allows for a period of time to monitor the potential shortfalls of \\nthe new recommendations as well as to assess whether the suggested guide-\\nlines can be achieved, a point that was repeatedly raised about the vitamin D\\nRDA.\\n3.4 Recommended intakes for vitamin D\\nIn recommending intakes for vitamin D, it must be recognized that in most\\nlocations in the world in a broad band around the equator (between latitudes\\n42°N and 42°S), the most physiologically relevant and efﬁcient way of \\nacquiring vitamin D is to synthesize it endogenously in the skin from \\n7-dehydrocholesterol by sun (UV) light exposure.

Out-\\nbreaks of idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia in the United Kingdom in the\\npost-World War II era led to the withdrawal of vitamin D fortiﬁcation from\\nall foods in that country because of concerns that they were due to hypervi-\\ntaminosis D. There are some suggestions in the literature that these outbreaks\\nof idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia may have involved genetic and dietary\\ncomponents and were not due strictly to technical problems with over-\\nfortiﬁcation as was assumed (49, 50). In retrospect, the termination of \\nthe vitamin D fortiﬁcation may have been counterproductive as it exposed\\nsegments of the United Kingdom community to vitamin D deﬁciency and\\nmay have discouraged other nations from starting vitamin D fortiﬁcation pro-\\ngrammes (50). This is all the more cause for concern because hypovitaminosis\\nD is still a problem worldwide, particularly in developing countries, at high\\nlatitudes and in countries where skin exposure to sunlight is discouraged (51).\\n3.6 Recommendations for future research\\nFurther research is needed to determine the following:'),\n",

A strik-\\ning feature of the system is that relatively small changes in calcium absorption\\nand excretion can neutralize a high intake or compensate for a low one. There\\nis a wide variation in calcium intake between countries, generally following\\nthe animal protein intake and depending largely on dairy product consump-\\ntion. The lowest calcium intakes occur in developing countries, particularly\\nin Asia, and the highest in developed countries, particularly in North America\\nand Europe (Table 4.1).\\n4.4.2 Calcium absorption\\nIngested calcium mixes with digestive juice calcium in the proximal small\\nintestine from where it is absorbed by a process which has an active saturable'),\n",

When calcium intake is low,\\ncalcium is mainly absorbed by active (transcellular) transport, but at higher\\nintakes, an increasing proportion of calcium is absorbed by simple (paracel-\\nlular) diffusion. The unabsorbed component appears in the faeces together\\nwith the unabsorbed component of digestive juice calcium known as endoge-\\nnous faecal calcium. Thus, the faeces contain unabsorbed dietary calcium and\\ndigestive juice calcium that was not reabsorbed (Figure 4.2).\\nTrue absorbed calcium is the total amount of calcium absorbed from the\\ncalcium pool in the intestines and therefore contains both dietary and diges-\\ntive juice components. Net absorbed calcium is the difference between dietary\\ncalcium and faecal calcium and is numerically the same as true absorbed\\ncalcium minus endogenous faecal calcium. At zero calcium intake, all the\\nfaecal calcium is endogenous and represents the digestive juice calcium which\\nhas not been reabsorbed; net absorbed calcium at this intake is therefore neg-\\native to the extent of about 200mg (5mmol) (28, 29). When the intake reaches\\nabout 200mg (5mmol), dietary and faecal calcium become equal and net\\nabsorbed calcium is zero. As calcium intake increases, net absorbed calcium\\nalso increases, steeply at ﬁrst but then, as the active transport becomes satu-\\nrated, more slowly until the slope of absorbed on ingested calcium approaches \\nlinearity with an ultimate gradient of about 5–10% (24, 25, 30, 31).

This issue is dealt with at greater length in the section on nutri-\\ntional factors (see section 4.10); in this section we will simply deﬁne what is\\nmeant by calcium requirement and how it may be calculated.\\nThe calcium requirement of an adult is generally recognized to be the intake\\nrequired to maintain calcium balance and therefore skeletal integrity. The mean\\ncalcium requirement of adults is therefore the mean intake at which intake and\\noutput are equal; at present this can only be determined by balance studies\\nconducted with sufﬁcient care, and over a sufﬁciently long period of time to\\nensure reasonable accuracy and then corrected for insensible losses.

This meticulous work has produced valuable balance data,\\nwhich are clearly valid; the mean duration of the 210 experiments from eight\\npublications used in this report to derive the recommended intakes was 90 days\\nwith a range of 6–480 days. (The four 6-day balance studies in the series used\\na non-absorbable marker and are therefore acceptable.)\\nThe usual way of determining mean calcium requirement from balance\\nstudies is by linear regression of calcium output (or calcium balance) on intake\\nand calculation of the mean intake at which intake and output are equal (or\\nbalance is zero). This was probably ﬁrst done in 1939 by Mitchell and Curzon\\n(46), who arrived at a mean requirement of 9.8mg/kg/day or about 640mg/day\\n(16mmol) for a mean body weight of 65kg.

A better reﬂection of biological reality is\\nobtained by deriving calcium output from the functions given previously (see\\nsection 4.4.2) and then regressing that output on calcium intake.

This recommended intake (which\\nis close to that derived differently by Matkovic and Heaney [49, 58]) is not\\nachieved by many adolescents even in developed countries (59–61), but the\\neffects of this shortfall on their growth and bone status are unknown.\\n4.6.4 Adults\\nAs indicated earlier and for the reasons given, the Consultation concluded\\nthat the mean apparent calcium requirement of adults in developed countries\\nis about 520mg (13mmol) but that this is increased by insensible losses to\\nsome 840mg (21mmol) (Figure 4.3). This reasoning forms the basis of the \\nrecommended intake for adults of 1000mg (Table 4.2).\\n4.6.5 Menopausal women\\nThe most important single cause of osteoporosis—at least in developed coun-\\ntries—is probably menopause, which is accompanied by an unequivocal and'),\n",

Because calcium absorption certainly does not increase at this\\ntime, and probably decreases (64, 65), this extra urinary calcium represents \\na negative calcium balance which is compatible with the average bone loss \\nof about 0.5–1.0% per year after menopause. There is a consensus that these\\nevents are associated with an increase in bone resorption but controversy con-\\ntinues about whether this is the primary event, the response to an increased\\ncalcium demand, or both. The results of calcium trials are clearly relevant.\\nBefore 1997, there had been 20 prospective trials of calcium supplementation\\nin 857 postmenopausal women and 625 control subjects; these trials collec-\\ntively showed a highly signiﬁcant suppression of bone loss through calcium\\nsupplementation (65). Another meta-analysis covering similar numbers\\nshowed that calcium supplementation signiﬁcantly enhanced the effect of\\nestrogen on bone (66). It is therefore logical to recommend sufﬁcient addi-\\ntional calcium after menopause to cover at least the extra obligatory loss of\\ncalcium in the urine. The additional dietary calcium needed to meet an\\nincreased urinary loss of 30mg (0.75mmol) is 260mg/day (6.5mmol/day)\\n(Figure 4.3), which raises the daily requirement from 840mg (21mmol) to\\n1100mg (27.5mmol) and the recommended intake from 1000 to 1300mg/day\\n(25 to 32.5mmol/day) (Table 4.2), which is a little higher than that recom-\\nmended by Canada and the United States (16) (see section 4.8).\\n4.6.6 Ageing adults\\nNot enough is known about bone and calcium metabolism during ageing \\nto enable calculation of the calcium requirements of older men and women\\nwith any conﬁdence.

Most of\\nthis calcium is laid down in the last trimester of pregnancy, during which \\nthe fetus retains about 240mg (6mmol) of calcium daily (51). There is \\nsome evidence that pregnancy is associated with an increase in calcium\\nabsorption (associated with a rise in the plasma 1,25-(OH)2 D level) (70–72).\\nFor a maternal urinary calcium of 120mg (3mmol) and a maternal skin loss\\nof 60mg (1.5mmol), the absorbed calcium should be 420mg (10.5mmol) \\ndaily. To achieve this optimal calcium absorption, the corresponding calcium\\nintake would need to be at least 940mg (23.5mmol) (Figure 4.6). The recom-\\nmended nutrient intake was thus set at 1200mg (30mmol) (Table 4.2), which\\nis similar to that proposed by Canada and the United States (16) (see section\\n4.8).\\n4.6.8 Lactating women\\nThe calcium content of human milk is about 36mg/100ml (9mmol/l) (18). A\\nlactating woman produces about 750ml of milk daily, which represents about\\n280mg (7.0mmol) of calcium. For a maternal urinary calcium of 100mg/day\\n(2.5mmol/day) and a maternal skin loss of 60mg/day (1.5mmol/day), the\\nrequired absorption is 440mg/day (11mmol/day)—the same as at puberty. If\\ncalcium absorption efﬁciency is maximal (i.e. 2 SD above the normal adult\\nmean)—possibly because of the effect of prolactin on the production of 1,25-\\n(OH)2D (72)—the requirement would be about 1040mg (26.0mmol) and the\\nrecommended intake would be about 1300mg (32.5mmol).

It is increasingly thought that lactational\\nbone loss is not a nutritional problem but may be due to the parathyroid\\nhormone-related peptide secreted by the breast (79) and is therefore beyond\\nthe control of dietary calcium.

Urinary calcium also rises very slowly with intake (slope\\nof 5–10%) and the risk of kidney stones from dietary hypercalciuria must\\ntherefore be negligible. In fact, it has been suggested that dietary calcium may\\nprotect against renal calculi because it binds dietary oxalate and reduces\\noxalate excretion (80, 81). Toxic effects of a high calcium intake have only\\nbeen described when the calcium is given as the carbonate form in very high\\ndoses; this toxicity is caused as much by the alkali as by the calcium and is\\ndue to precipitation of calcium salts in renal tissue (milk-alkali syndrome)\\n(82).

There is also suggestive evidence that hip fracture rates (as\\njudged by mortality from falls in elderly people across the world) are a func-\\ntion of protein intake, national income, and latitude (107). The latter associ-\\nation is particularly interesting in view of the strong evidence of vitamin D\\ndeﬁciency in hip fracture patients in the developed world (108–114) and the\\nsuccessful prevention of such fractures with small doses of vitamin D and\\ncalcium (115, 116) (see Chapter 3). It is therefore possible that hip fracture\\nrates may be related to protein intake, vitamin D status, or both, and that\\neither of these factors could explain the calcium paradox.\\n4.10 Nutritional factors affecting calcium requirement\\nThe calcium requirements proposed in Table 4.2 are based on data from devel-\\noped countries (notably Norway and the United States) and can only be\\napplied with any conﬁdence to countries and populations with similar dietary\\ncultures. Other dietary cultures may entail different calcium requirements and\\ncall for different recommendations. In particular, the removal or addition of\\nany nutrient that affects calcium absorption or excretion must have an effect\\non calcium requirement. Two such nutrients are sodium and animal protein,\\nboth of which increase urinary calcium and therefore must be presumed to\\nincrease calcium requirement. A third candidate is vitamin D because of its\\nrole in calcium homeostasis and calcium absorption.\\n4.10.1 Sodium\\nIt has been known at least since 1961 that urinary calcium is related to urinary\\nsodium (117) and that sodium administration raises calcium excretion, pre-\\nsumably because sodium competes with calcium for reabsorption in the renal\\ntubules. Regarding the quantitative relationships between the renal handling\\nof sodium and calcium, the ﬁltered load of sodium is about 100 times that of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='of sodium and calcium, the ﬁltered load of sodium is about 100 times that of\\ncalcium (in molar terms) but the clearance of these two elements is similar at\\nabout 1ml/min, which yields about 99% reabsorption and 1% excretion for\\nboth (118). However, these are approximations which conceal the close\\ndependence of urinary sodium on sodium intake and the weaker dependence\\nof urinary calcium on calcium intake. It is an empirical fact that urinary\\nsodium and calcium are signiﬁcantly related in normal and hypercalciuric sub-\\njects on freely chosen diets (119–122). The slope of urinary calcium on sodium\\nvaries in published work from about 0.6% to 1.2% (in molar terms); a rep-\\nresentative ﬁgure is about 1%, that is, 100mmol of sodium (2.3g) takes out\\nabout 1mmol (40mg) of calcium (63, 120). The biological signiﬁcance of this\\nrelationship is supported by the accelerated osteoporosis induced by feeding\\nsalt to rats on low-calcium diets (123) and the effects of salt administration\\nand salt restriction on markers of bone resorption in postmenopausal women\\n(124, 125). Because salt restriction lowers urinary calcium, it is likely also to\\nlower calcium requirement and, conversely, salt feeding is likely to increase\\ncalcium requirement. This is illustrated in Figure 4.7, which shows that low-\\nering sodium intake by 100mmol (2.3g) from, for example, 150 to 50mmol\\n(3.45 to 1.15g), reduces the theoretical calcium requirement from 840mg \\n(21mmol) to 600mg (15mmol). However, the implications of this for global\\ncalcium requirements cannot be computed because information on sodium\\nintake is available from only a very few countries (126).\\n4.10.2 Protein\\nThe positive effect of dietary protein—particularly animal protein—on\\nurinary calcium has also been known since at least the 1960s (127–129).

A meta-analysis of 16 studies in 154 adult humans on protein\\nintakes of up to 200g found that 1.2mg of calcium was lost in the urine for\\nevery 1-g rise in dietary protein (131). A small but more focused study showed\\na rise of 40mg in urinary calcium when dietary animal protein was raised from\\n40 to 80g (i.e. within the physiological range) (132). This ratio of urinary\\ncalcium to dietary protein (1mg to 1g) was adopted by the Expert Consulta-\\ntion as a representative value. This means that a 40-g reduction in animal\\nprotein intake from 60 to 20g (roughly the difference between the developed\\nand developing regions shown in Table 4.1) would reduce calcium require-\\nment by the same amount as a 2.3-g reduction in dietary sodium (i.e. from\\n840 to 600mg) (Figure 4.7).\\n4.

However, plasma 25-OH-D closely reﬂects vitamin D nutritional\\nstatus and because it is the substrate for the renal enzyme which produces\\n1,25-(OH)2D, it could have an indirect effect on calcium absorption. The\\nplasma level of 1,25-(OH)2D is principally regulated by gene expression of 1-\\na-hydroxylase (CYP1a) and not by the plasma concentration of 25-OH-D.\\nThis has been seen consistently in animal studies, and the high calcium absorp-\\ntion (138) and high plasma concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D (139) observed in\\nGambian mothers are consistent with this type of adaptation.

In adults, the rate of calcium absorp-\\ntion from the gastrointestinal tract needs to match the rate of all losses from\\nthe body if the skeleton is to be preserved; in children and adolescents, an\\nextra input is needed to cover the requirements of skeletal growth.\\nCompared with that of other minerals, calcium economy is relatively inef-\\nﬁcient. On most intakes, only about 25–30% of dietary calcium is effectively\\nabsorbed and obligatory calcium losses are relatively large.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='it would probably be agreed that any form of osteoporosis must inevitably\\nbe aggravated by negative external calcium balance. Such negative balance—\\neven for short periods—is prejudicial because it takes so much longer to\\nrebuild bone than to destroy it. Bone that is lost, even during short periods\\nof calcium deﬁciency, is only slowly replaced when adequate amounts of\\ncalcium become available.\\nIn seeking to deﬁne advisable calcium intakes on the basis of physiological\\nstudies and clinical observations, nutrition authorities have to rely largely on\\ndata from developed countries living at relatively high latitudes. Although it\\nis now possible to formulate recommendations that are appropriate to differ-\\nent stages in the lifecycle of the populations of these countries, extrapolation\\nfrom these ﬁgures to other cultures and nutritional environments can only be\\ntentative and must rely on what is known of nutritional and environmental\\neffects on calcium absorption and excretion. Nonetheless, an attempt in this\\ndirection has been made, in full knowledge that the speculative calculations\\nmay be incorrect because of other variables not yet identiﬁed.\\nNo reference has been made in this discussion to the possible beneﬁcial\\neffects of calcium in the prevention or treatment of pre-eclampsia (142), colon\\ncancer (143), or hypertension (144) and no attempt has been made to use these\\nconditions as end-points on which to base calcium intakes. In each of the\\nabove conditions, epidemiological data suggest an association with calcium\\nintake, and experimentation with increased calcium intakes has now been\\ntried. In each case the results have been disappointing, inconclusive, or nega-\\ntive (145–147) and have stirred controversy (148–150).

Therefore, a complex antioxidant defence\\nsystem normally protects cells from the injurious effects of endogenously\\nproduced free radicals as well as from species of exogenous origin such as cig-\\narette smoke and pollutants. Should our exposure to free radicals exceed the\\nprotective capacity of the antioxidant defence system, a phenomenon often\\nreferred to as oxidative stress (2), then damage to biological molecules may\\noccur. There is considerable evidence that disease causes an increase in oxida-\\ntive stress; therefore, consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, which are\\npotentially able to quench or neutralize excess radicals, may play an impor-\\ntant role in modifying the development of disease.\\nVitamin E is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in the cell antioxidant\\ndefence system and is exclusively obtained from the diet. The term “vitamin\\nE” refers to a family of eight naturally-occurring homologues that are syn-\\nthesized by plants from homogentisic acid. All are derivatives of 6-chromanol\\nand differ in the number and position of methyl groups on the ring structure.\\nThe four tocopherol homologues (d-a-, d-b-, d-g-, and d-d-) have a saturated\\n16-carbon phytyl side chain, whereas the four tocotrienols (d-a-, d-b-, d-g-,\\nand d-d-) have three double bonds on the side chain. There is also a widely\\navailable synthetic form, dl-a-tocopherol, prepared by coupling trimethyl-\\nhydroquinone with isophytol. This consists of a mixture of eight stereoiso-\\nmers in approximately equal amounts; these isomers are differentiated by\\nrotations of the phytyl chain in various directions that do not occur naturally.\\nFor dietary purposes, vitamin E activity is expressed as a-tocopherol equiv-\\nalents (a-TEs). One a-TE is the activity of 1mg RRR-a-tocopherol (d-a-toco-\\npherol). To estimate the a-TE of a mixed diet containing natural forms of\\nvitamin E, the number of milligrams of b-tocopherol should be multiplied by'),\n",

Any of the synthetic all-rac-\\na-tocopherols (dl-a-tocopherol) should be multiplied by 0.74. One milligram\\nof the latter compound in the acetate form is equivalent to 1IU of vitamin E.\\nVitamin E is an example of a phenolic antioxidant. Such molecules readily\\ndonate the hydrogen from the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the ring structure\\nto free radicals, making them unreactive. On donating the hydrogen, the phe-\\nnolic compound itself becomes a relatively unreactive free radical because the\\nunpaired electron on the oxygen atom is usually delocalized into the aromatic\\nring structure thereby increasing its stability (3).\\nThe major biological role of vitamin E is to protect PUFAs and other com-\\nponents of cell membranes and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxida-\\ntion by free radicals. Vitamin E is located primarily within the phospholipid\\nbilayer of cell membranes. It is particularly effective in preventing lipid per-\\noxidation—a series of chemical reactions involving the oxidative deterioration\\nof PUFAs (see Chapter 8 on antioxidants). Elevated levels of lipid peroxida-\\ntion products are associated with numerous diseases and clinical conditions\\n(4). Although vitamin E is primarily located in cell and organelle membranes\\nwhere it can exert its maximum protective effect, its concentration may only\\nbe one molecule for every 2000 phospholipid molecules. This suggests that\\nafter its reaction with free radicals it is rapidly regenerated, possibly by other\\nantioxidants (5).\\nAbsorption of vitamin E from the intestine depends on adequate pancreatic\\nfunction, biliary secretion, and micelle formation.

Emulsiﬁcation takes place initially in\\nthe stomach and then in the small intestine in the presence of pancreatic and\\nbiliary secretions. The resulting mixed micelle aggregates the vitamin E mol-\\necules, solubilizes the vitamin E, and then transports it to the brush border\\nmembrane of the enterocyte, probably by passive diffusion. Within the ente-\\nrocyte, tocopherol is incorporated into chylomicrons and secreted into the\\nintracellular space and lymphatic system and subsequently into the blood\\nstream. Tocopherol esters, present in processed foods and vitamin supple-\\nments, must be hydrolysed in the small intestine before absorption.\\nVitamin E is transported in the blood by the plasma lipoproteins and ery-\\nthrocytes. Chylomicrons carry tocopherol from the enterocyte to the liver,\\nwhere they are incorporated into parenchymal cells as chylomicron remnants.\\nThe catabolism of chylomicrons takes place in the systemic circulation\\nthrough the action of cellular lipoprotein, lipase. During this process toco-\\npherol can be transferred to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). The toco-\\npherol in HDLs can transfer to other circulating lipoproteins, such as LDLs\\n5. VITAMIN E\\n95\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n96\\nand very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) (7). During the conversion of\\nVLDL to LDL in the circulation, some a-tocopherol remains within the core\\nlipids and is thus incorporated in LDL. Most a-tocopherol then enters the\\ncells of peripheral tissues within the intact lipoprotein through the LDL\\nreceptor pathway, although some may be taken up by membrane binding sites\\nrecognizing apolipoprotein A-I and A-II present on HDL (8).\\nAlthough the process of absorption of all the tocopherol homologues in\\nthe diet is similar, the a form predominates in blood and tissue.

From a nutritional perspective, the most\\nimportant form of vitamin E is a-tocopherol; this is corroborated in animal\\nmodel tests of biopotency which assess the ability of the various homologues\\nto prevent fetal absorption and muscular dystrophies (Table 5.1).\\nPlasma vitamin E concentrations vary little over a wide range of dietary\\nintakes.

The brain is markedly resistant to depletion of, and repletion with,\\nvitamin E (16). This presumably reﬂects an adaptive mechanism to avoid\\ndetrimental oxidative reactions in this key organ.\\nThe primary oxidation product of a-tocopherol is a-tocopheryl quinone\\nthat can be conjugated to yield the glucuronate after prior reduction to the\\nhydroquinone. This glucuronide is excreted in the bile as such or further\\ndegraded in the kidneys to a-tocopheronic acid glucuronide and hence\\nexcreted in the bile. Those vitamin E homologues not preferentially selected\\nby the hepatic binding proteins are eliminated during the process of nascent\\nVLDL secretion in the liver and probably excreted via the bile (17). Some\\nvitamin E may also be excreted via skin sebaceous glands (18).\\n5.2 Populations at risk for vitamin E deficiency\\nThere are many signs of vitamin E deﬁciency in animals, most of which are\\nrelated to damage to cell membranes and leakage of cell contents to external\\nﬂuids.

However, there was no inﬂuence of dietary\\nvitamin E alone on incidence of cardiovascular disease when those taking sup-\\nplements were removed from the analyses. A possible explanation for the sig-\\nniﬁcant relationship between dietary vitamin E and cardiovascular disease in\\nEuropean countries but not in the United States may be found in the fact that\\nacross Europe populations consume foods with widely differing amounts of\\nvitamin E. Sunﬂower seed oil, which is rich in a-tocopherol, tends to be con-\\nsumed more widely in the southern European countries where a lower inci-\\ndence of cardiovascular disease is reported, than in northern European\\ncountries where soybean oil, which contains more of the g form, is preferred\\n(31) (Table 5.3).

Exceptions may be during ecologic disasters and cultural conﬂicts\\nresulting in food deprivation and famine.\\nAnalysis of the FAO country food balance sheets indicates that about half\\nthe a-tocopherol in a typical northern European diet, such as in the United\\nKingdom, is derived from vegetable oils (31). Animal fats, vegetables, and\\nmeats each contribute about 10% to the total per capita supply and fruit, nuts,\\ncereals, and dairy products each contribute about 4%.

This variation can be ascribed mainly to the\\ntype and quantity of dietary oils used in different countries and the propor-\\ntion of the different homologues in the oils (Table 5.4).

Despite its important biological antioxidant\\nproperties, there is no consistent evidence that supplementing the diet with\\nvitamin E protects against chronic disease. The main function of vitamin E,\\nwhich appears to be that of preventing oxidation of PUFAs, has nevertheless\\nbeen used by the present Consultation as the basis for proposing RNIs for\\nvitamin E because of the considerable evidence in different animal species that\\nlow levels of vitamin E combined with an excess of PUFAs give rise to a wide\\nvariety of clinical signs.\\nThere is very little clinical evidence of deﬁciency disease in humans except\\nin certain inherited conditions where the metabolism of vitamin E is dis-\\nturbed.

It is worth noting that only\\n11 (0.7%) out of 1629 adults in the 1986–1987 British Nutrition Survey had a-\\ntocopherol–cholesterol ratios <2.25. Furthermore, although the high intake of\\nsoybean oil, with its high content of g-tocopherol, substitutes for the intake of\\na-tocopherol in the British diet, a comparison of a-tocopherol–cholesterol\\nratios found almost identical results in two groups of randomly-selected,\\nmiddle-aged adults in Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Toulouse (France), two\\ncountries with very different intakes of a-tocopherol (36) and cardiovascular\\nrisk (32).\\nIt has been suggested that when the main PUFA in the diet is linoleic acid,\\na d-a-tocopherol–PUFA ratio of 0.4 (expressed as mg tocopherol per g\\nPUFA) is adequate for adult humans (46, 47). This ratio has been recom-\\nmended in the United Kingdom for infant formulas (48).

Vitamin K\\n6.1 Introduction\\nVitamin K is an essential fat-soluble micronutrient, which is needed for a\\nunique post-translational chemical modiﬁcation in a small group of proteins\\nwith calcium-binding properties, collectively known as vitamin K-dependent\\nproteins or Gla proteins. Thus far, the only unequivocal role of vitamin K \\nin health is in the maintenance of normal coagulation. The vitamin K-\\ndependent coagulation proteins are synthesized in the liver and comprise\\nfactors II, VII, IX, and X, which have a haemostatic role (i.e. they are proco-\\nagulants that arrest and prevent bleeding), and proteins C and S, which have\\nan anticoagulant role (i.e. they inhibit the clotting process). Despite this\\nduality of function, the overriding effect of nutritional vitamin K deﬁciency\\nis a bleeding tendency caused by the relative inactivity of the procoagulant\\nproteins. Vitamin K-dependent proteins synthesized by other tissues include\\nthe bone protein osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, though their functions\\nremain to be clariﬁed.\\n6.2 Biological role of vitamin K\\nVitamin K is the family name for a series of fat-soluble compounds which\\nhave a common 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone nucleus but differ in the struc-\\ntures of a side chain at the 3-position. They are synthesized by plants and bac-\\nteria. In plants the only important molecular form is phylloquinone (vitamin\\nK1), which has a phytyl side chain. Bacteria synthesize a family of compounds\\ncalled menaquinones (vitamin K2), which have side chains based on repeating\\nunsaturated 5-carbon (prenyl) units. These are designated menaquinone-n\\n(MK-n) according to the number (n) of prenyl units. Some bacteria also syn-'),\n",

Some bacteria also syn-\\nthesize menaquinones in which one or more of the double bonds is saturated.\\nThe compound 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (common name menadione)\\nmay be regarded as a provitamin because vertebrates can convert it to MK-4\\nby adding a 4-prenyl side chain at the 3-position.\\nThe biological role of vitamin K is to act as a cofactor for a speciﬁc \\ncarboxylation reaction that transforms selective glutamate (Glu) residues to\\ng-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues (1, 2). The reaction is catalysed by a micro-\\nsomal enzyme, g-glutamyl, or vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which in\\nturn is linked to a cyclic salvage pathway known as the vitamin K epoxide\\ncycle (Figure 6.1).\\nThe four vitamin K-dependent procoagulants (factor II or prothrombin,\\nand factors VII, IX, and X) are serine proteases that are synthesized in the\\nliver and then secreted into the circulation as inactive forms (zymogens). Their\\nbiological activity depends on their normal complement of Gla residues,\\nwhich are efﬁcient chelators of calcium ions. In the presence of Gla residues\\nand calcium ions these proteins bind to the surface membrane phospholipids\\nof platelets and endothelial cells where, together with other cofactors, they\\nform membrane-bound enzyme complexes. When coagulation is initiated, the\\nzymogens of the four vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are cleaved to\\n6.

Known enzyme reactions are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The carboxylation\\nreaction is driven by a vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity (reaction 1), which\\nsimultaneously converts vitamin K quinol to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide. Vitamin K 2,3-epoxide is\\nreduced back to the quinone and then to the quinol by vitamin K epoxide reductase (reaction\\n2). The reductase activity denoted reaction 2 is dithiol dependent and is inhibited by coumarin\\nanticoagulants such as warfarin.

Protein\\nS acts as a synergistic cofactor to protein C by enhancing the binding of acti-\\nvated protein C to negatively charged phospholipids. There is evidence that\\nprotein S is synthesized by several tissues including the blood vessel wall and\\nbone and may have other functions besides its well-established role as a coag-\\nulation inhibitor.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='unknown.\\nApart from the coagulation proteins, several other vitamin K-dependent\\nproteins have been isolated from bone, cartilage, kidney, lungs, and other\\ntissues (4, 5). Only two, osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein (MGP), have \\nbeen well characterized. Both are found in bone but MGP also occurs in \\ncartilage, blood vessel walls, and other soft tissues. It seems likely that one\\nfunction of MGP is to inhibit mineralization (6). Thus far, no clear biologi-\\ncal role for osteocalcin has been established despite its being the major non-\\ncollagenous bone protein synthesized by osteoblasts (7–9). This failure to\\nestablish a biological function for osteocalcin has hampered studies of the pos-\\nsible detrimental effects of vitamin K deﬁciency on bone health. Evidence of\\na possible association of a suboptimal vitamin K status with increased frac-\\nture risk remains to be conﬁrmed (7–9).\\n6.3 Overview of vitamin K metabolism\\n6.3.1 Absorption and transport\\nDietary vitamin K, mainly phylloquinone, is absorbed chemically unchanged\\nfrom the proximal intestine after solubilization into mixed micelles composed\\nof bile salts and the products of pancreatic lipolysis (10). In healthy adults the\\nefﬁciency of absorption of phylloquinone in its free form is about 80% (10,\\n11). Within the intestinal mucosa the vitamin is incorporated into chylomi-\\ncrons, is secreted into the lymph, and enters the blood via the lacteals (11, 12).\\nOnce in the circulation, phylloquinone is rapidly cleared (10) at a \\nrate consistent with its continuing association with chylomicrons and the \\nchylomicron remnants, which are produced by lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis\\nat the surface of capillary endothelial cells (13). After an overnight fast, more\\nthan half of the circulating phylloquinone is still associated with triglyceride-\\nrich lipoproteins, with the remainder being equally distributed between \\nlow-density and high-density lipoproteins (13). Although phylloquinone is'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='low-density and high-density lipoproteins (13). Although phylloquinone is\\nthe major circulating form of vitamin K, MK-7 is also present in plasma, at\\nlower concentrations and with a lipoprotein distribution similar to phyllo-\\nquinone (13). Although phylloquinone in blood must have been derived\\nexclusively from the diet, it is not known whether circulating menaquinones\\nsuch as MK-7 are derived from the diet, intestinal ﬂora, or a combination of\\nthese sources.\\n6.3.2 Tissue stores and distribution\\nUntil the 1970s, the liver was the only known site of synthesis of vitamin K-\\ndependent proteins and hence was presumed to be the only signiﬁcant storage\\nsite for the vitamin. However, the discovery of vitamin K-dependent\\nprocesses and proteins in a number of extra-hepatic tissues suggests that this\\nmay not be the case (see section 6.2).\\nHuman liver stores normally comprise about 90% menaquinones and 10%\\nphylloquinone (14, 15). There is evidence that the phylloquinone liver stores\\nare very labile; under conditions of severe dietary depletion, liver concentra-\\ntions were reduced to about 25% of their initial levels after only 3 days (15).\\nThis high turnover of hepatic reserves of phylloquinone is in accord with the\\nhigh losses of this vitamer through excretion (10).\\nKnowledge of hepatic stores of phylloquinone in different population\\ngroups is limited. Adult hepatic stores in a United Kingdom study were about\\n11pmol/g (14) whereas in a study from Japan they were about two-fold higher\\n(15). Such reserves are about 20000–40000-fold lower than those for retinol\\nfor relative daily intakes of phylloquinone that are only about 10-fold lower\\nthan those of vitamin A (16).\\nThe relationship between hepatic and total-body stores of vitamin K is not\\nknown.

It has been reported that the predominant vitamer\\nin human cortical and trabecular bone is phylloquinone; unlike the situation\\nin liver, no menaquinones higher than MK-8 were detected (17).\\nIn contrast to the hepatic preponderance of long-chain menaquinones, \\nthe major circulating form of vitamin K is invariably phylloquinone. The\\nmenaquinones MK-7, and possibly MK-8, are also present but the common\\nhepatic forms, MKs 9–13, are not detectable in blood plasma (16, 18). This\\nmay be a consequence of a different route of absorption (e.g. the possibility\\nof a portal route for long-chain MKs versus the established lymphatic route\\nfor phylloquinone), but might also suggest that once in the liver, the lipophilic\\nlong-chain menaquinones are not easily mobilized (16, 18, 19).\\n6.

This information is important because of the prepon-\\nderance of long-chain menaquinones in human liver. Early bioassay data from\\nrats suggested that long-chain menaquinones (MK-7, -9, and -10) were more\\nefﬁcient than phylloquinone in reversing vitamin K deﬁciency when single\\ndoses were given parenterally and that their sustained effect on vitamin K\\nstatus may be due to their slower hepatic turnover (18, 19). Groenen-van\\nDooren et al. (20) also observed a longer duration of the biological response\\nof MK-9 compared with phylloquinone in vitamin K-deﬁcient rats. On the\\nother hand, Will and Suttie (21) showed that when given orally, the dietary\\nrequirement for MK-9 for the maintenance of prothrombin synthesis in rats\\nis higher than that for phylloquinone. They also reported that the initial\\nhepatic turnover of MK-9 was two- to three-fold slower than that of \\nphylloquinone.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='hepatic turnover of MK-9 was two- to three-fold slower than that of \\nphylloquinone.\\nSuttie (18) emphasized that the existence of a large pool of menaquinones\\nin human liver does not necessarily mean that menaquinones make a propor-\\ntionately greater contribution to the maintenance of vitamin K sufﬁciency. \\nIn humans, however, the development of subclinical signs of vitamin K deﬁ-\\nciency detected in dietary phylloquinone restriction studies argues against\\nthis, especially when placed alongside the lack of change of hepatic\\nmenaquinone stores (15). One explanation is that many of the hepatic\\nmenaquinones are not biologically available to the microsomal g-glutamyl car-\\nboxylase because of their different subcellular location; for instance, they may\\nbe located in the mitochondria and possibly other non-microsomal sites (18).\\n6.3.4 Excretion\\nVitamin K is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine\\nand bile. In tracer experiments about 20% of an injected dose of phylloqui-\\nnone was recovered in the urine whereas about 40–50% was excreted in the\\nfaeces via the bile (10); the proportion excreted was the same regardless of\\nwhether the injected dose was 1mg or 45mg. It seems likely, therefore, that\\nabout 60–70% of the amount of phylloquinone absorbed from each meal will\\nultimately be lost to the body by excretion. These results suggest that the\\nbody stores of phylloquinone are being constantly replenished.\\nThe main urinary excretory products have been identiﬁed as carboxylic\\nacids with 5- and 7-carbon side chains, which are excreted as glucuronide con-\\njugates (10). The biliary metabolites have not been clearly identiﬁed but are\\ninitially excreted as water-soluble conjugates and become lipid soluble during\\ntheir passage through the gastrointestinal tract, probably through deconjuga-\\ntion by the intestinal ﬂora.

The deﬁciency syndrome is traditionally known as haemorrhagic disease\\nof the newborn. More recently, in order to give a better deﬁnition of the cause,\\nit has been termed vitamin K deﬁciency bleeding (VKDB).\\nThe time of onset of VKDB is now thought to be more unpredictable than\\npreviously supposed; currently three distinct syndromes are recognized:\\nearly, classic, and late VKDB (Table 6.1). Until the 1960s, VKDB was con-\\nsidered to be solely a problem of the ﬁrst week of life. Then, in 1966, came\\nthe ﬁrst reports from Thailand of a new vitamin K deﬁciency syndrome that\\ntypically presented between 1 and 2 months of life and which is now termed\\nlate VKDB.

This increased incidence was\\nascribed to a decrease in the practice of vitamin K prophylaxis and to an\\nincreased trend towards exclusive human-milk feeding (25).\\nWithout vitamin K prophylaxis, the incidence of late VKDB (per 100000\\nbirths), based on acceptable surveillance data, has been estimated to be 4.4 in\\nthe United Kingdom, 7.2 in Germany, and as high as 72 in Thailand (26). Of\\nreal concern is that late VKDB, unlike the classic form, has a high incidence\\nof death or severe and permanent brain damage resulting from intracranial\\nhaemorrhage (19, 22, 23).\\nEpidemiological studies worldwide have identiﬁed two major risk factors\\nfor both classic and late VKDB: exclusive human-milk feeding and the failure\\nto give any vitamin K prophylaxis (19, 22, 23). The increased risk for infants\\nfed human milk compared with formula milk is probably related to the rela-\\ntively low concentrations of vitamin K (phylloquinone) in breast milk com-\\npared with formula milks (27–29). For classic VKDB, studies using the\\ndetection of under-carboxylated prothrombin or proteins induced by vitamin\\nK absence (PIVKA-II) as a marker of subclinical vitamin K deﬁciency have\\nsuggested that it is the low cumulative intake of human milk in the ﬁrst week\\nof life rather than an abnormally low milk concentration per se that seems to\\nbe of greater relevance (30, 31).

The degree of cholestasis may be mild and its\\ncourse may be transient and self-correcting, but affected infants will have an\\nincreased dietary requirement for vitamin K because of reduced absorption\\nefﬁciency.\\n6.4.2 Vitamin K prophylaxis in infants\\nAs bleeding can occur spontaneously and because no screening test is avail-\\nable, it is now common paediatric practice to protect all infants by giving\\nvitamin K supplements in the immediate perinatal period. Vitamin K pro-\\nphylaxis has had a chequered history but in recent years has become a high-\\nproﬁle issue of public health in many countries throughout the world. The\\nreasons for this are two-fold. First, there is now a convincing body of evi-\\ndence showing that without vitamin K prophylaxis, infants have a small but\\nreal risk of dying from, or being permanently brain damaged by, vitamin K\\ndeﬁciency in the ﬁrst 6 months of life (19, 22, 23). The other, much less certain\\nevidence stems from a reported epidemiological association between vitamin\\nK given intramuscularly (but not orally) and the later development of child-\\nhood cancer (32). The debate, both scientiﬁc and public, which followed this\\nand other publications has led to an increase in the use of multiple oral sup-\\nplements instead of the traditional single intramuscular injection (usually of\\n1mg phylloquinone) given at birth. Although most of the subsequent epi-\\ndemiological studies have not conﬁrmed any cancer link with vitamin K pro-\\nphylaxis, the issue is still not resolved (33, 34).'),\n",

Phylloquinone is dis-\\ntributed ubiquitously throughout the diet, and the range of concentrations in\\ndifferent food categories is very wide. In general, the relative values in veg-\\netables conﬁrm the known association of phylloquinone with photosynthetic\\ntissues, with the highest values (normally in the range 400–700mg/100g) being\\nfound in green leafy vegetables. The next best sources are certain vegetable\\noils (e.g. soybean, rapeseed, and olive), which contain 50–200mg/100g; other\\nvegetable oils, such as peanut, corn, sunﬂower, and safﬂower, however,\\ncontain much lower amounts of phylloquinone (1–10mg/100g). The great \\ndifferences between vegetable oils with respect to vitamin K content obvi-\\nously present problems for calculating the phylloquinone contents of oil-\\ncontaining foods when the type of oil is not known.\\nMenaquinones seem to have a more restricted distribution in the diet than\\ndoes phylloquinone.

MK-4 may be synthesized in\\nanimal tissues from menadione supplied in animal feed. Another imponder-\\nable factor is the evidence that animal tissues and dairy produce may contain\\nsome MK-4 as a product of tissue synthesis from phylloquinone itself (37).\\nKnowledge of the vitamin K content of human milk has been the subject\\nof methodologic controversies with a 10-fold variation in reported values of\\nphylloquinone concentrations of mature human milk (38). Where milk sam-\\npling and analytical techniques have met certain criteria for their validity, the\\nphylloquinone content of mature milk has generally ranged between 1 and \\n4mg/l, with average concentrations near the lower end of this range (28, 29,\\n38). However, there is considerable intra- and intersubject variation, and levels\\nare higher in colostral milk than in mature milk (28). Menaquinone concen-\\ntrations in human milk have not been accurately determined but appear to be\\nmuch lower than those of phylloquinone. Phylloquinone concentrations in\\ninfant formula milk range from 3 to 16mg/l in unsupplemented formulas and\\nup to 100mg/l in fortiﬁed formulas (26). Currently most formulas are forti-\\nﬁed; typical phylloquinone concentrations are about 50mg/l.\\n6.5.2 Bioavailability of vitamin K from foods\\nVery little is known about the bioavailability of the K vitamins from differ-\\nent foods. It has been estimated that the efﬁciency of absorption of phyllo-\\nquinone from boiled spinach (eaten with butter) is no greater than 10% (39)\\ncompared with an estimated 80% when phylloquinone is given in its free form\\n(10, 11).

The poor extraction of phylloquinone from leafy vegeta-\\nbles, which as a category represents the single greatest food source of phyl-\\nloquinone, may place a different perspective on the relative importance of\\nother foods with lower concentrations of phylloquinone (e.g. those contain-\\ning soybean and rapeseed oils) but in which the vitamin is not tightly bound\\nand its bioavailability likely to be greater. Even before bioavailability was\\ntaken into account, fats and oils that are contained in mixed dishes were found\\nto make an important contribution to the phylloquinone content of the\\nUnited States diet (40) and in a United Kingdom study, contributed 30% of\\nthe total dietary intake (41).\\nNo data exist on the efﬁciency of intestinal absorption of dietary long-chain\\nmenaquinones. Because the lipophilic properties of menaquinones are greater\\nthan those of phylloquinone, it is likely that the efﬁciency of their absorp-\\ntion, in the free form, is low, as has been suggested by animal studies (18, 21).\\n6.5.3 Importance of intestinal bacterial synthesis as a source of\\nvitamin K\\nIntestinal microﬂora synthesize large amounts of menaquinones, which are\\npotentially available as a source of vitamin K (42).

The widespread presence of MKs 10–13 in human livers at\\nhigh concentrations (14, 15) therefore suggests that these forms, at least, orig-\\ninate from intestinal synthesis (16).\\nIt is commonly held that animals and humans obtain a signiﬁcant fraction\\nof their vitamin K requirement from direct absorption of menaquinones pro-\\nduced by microﬂoral synthesis (43), but conclusive experimental evidence\\ndocumenting the site and extent of absorption is singularly lacking (18, 19,\\n23).

Several types of assay for PIVKA-II have been\\ndeveloped which vary in their sensitivity (44).\\nIn the same way that vitamin K deﬁciency causes PIVKA-II to be released\\ninto the circulation from the liver, a deﬁcit of vitamin K in bone will cause\\nthe osteoblasts to secrete under-carboxylated species of osteocalcin (ucOC)\\ninto the bloodstream. It has been proposed that the concentration of \\ncirculating ucOC reﬂects the sufﬁciency of vitamin K for the carboxylation\\nof this Gla protein in bone tissue (7, 45).

After this depletion phase the subjects\\nentered a 16-day repletion period during which, over 4-day intervals, they\\nwere sequentially repleted with 5, 15, 25, and 45mg of phylloquinone.

The most dramatic change was in plasma levels of phylloquinone,\\nwhich fell to about 15% of the values determined on day 1. The drop in\\nplasma phylloquinone also suggested that the average dietary intake of these\\nparticular individuals before they entered the study had been greater than the\\nbaseline diet of 80mg/day.

To protect the few\\naffected infants, most developed and some developing countries have insti-\\ntuted a blanket prophylactic policy to protect infants at risk, a policy that is\\nendorsed by the present Consultation (Table 6.4). The numbers of infants at\\nrisk without such a programme has a geographic component, the risk being\\nmore prevalent in Asia, and a dietary component, with solely human-\\nmilk-fed babies having the highest risk (22, 23, 27). Of the etiologic factors,\\nsome of which may still be unrecognized, one factor in some infants is mild\\ncholestasis. The problem of overcoming a variable and, in some infants, inef-\\nﬁcient absorption is the likely reason that oral prophylactic regimens, even\\nwith two or three pharmacologic doses (1mg phylloquinone), have occasion-\\nally failed to prevent VKDB (63). This makes it difﬁcult to design an effec-\\ntive oral prophylaxis regimen that is comparable in efﬁcacy with the previous'),\n",

To prevent bleeding due to vitamin K deﬁciency, it\\nis recommended that all breast-fed infants should receive vitamin K\\nsupplementation at birth according to nationally approved\\nguidelines. Vitamin K formulations and prophylactic regimes differ\\nfrom country to country. Guidelines range from a single\\nintramuscular injection (usually 1mg of phylloquinone) given at birth\\nto multiple oral doses given over the ﬁrst few weeks of life.\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n124\\nInfants who have been entirely fed with supplemented formulas are well\\nprotected against VKDB and on intakes of around 50mg/day have plasma\\nlevels that are about 10-fold higher than the adult average of about 1.0nmol/l\\n(0.5mg/l) (29) (Table 6.2). Clearly then, an optimal intake would lie below an\\nintake of 50mg/day. Cornelissen et al. (64) evaluated the effectiveness of giving\\ninfants a daily supplement of 25mg phylloquinone after they had received a\\nsingle oral dose of 1mg at birth. This regimen resulted in median plasma levels'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='single oral dose of 1mg at birth. This regimen resulted in median plasma levels\\nat ages 4, 8, and 12 weeks of around 2.2nmol/l (1.0mg/l) when sampled 20–28\\nhours after the most recent vitamin K dose; this level corresponds to the upper\\nend of the adult fasting range. In 12-week-old infants supplemented with this\\nregime, the median plasma level was about four-fold higher than that in a\\ncontrol group of unsupplemented infants (1.9 versus 0.5nmol/l). Also none\\nof the 50 supplemented infants had detectable PIVKA-II at 12 weeks com-\\npared with 15 of 131 infants (11.5%) in the control group. This regime has\\nnow been implemented in the Netherlands and surveillance data on late\\nVKDB suggest that it may be as effective as parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis\\n(63).\\nThe fact that VKDB is epidemiologically associated with breastfeeding\\nmeans that it is not prudent to base requirements solely on normal intakes of\\nhuman milk and justiﬁes the setting of a higher value that can only be met by\\nsome form of supplementation. The current United States RDA for infants is\\n5mg/day for the ﬁrst 6 months (the greatest period of risk for VKDB) and \\n10mg/day during the second 6 months (54). These intakes are based on the\\nadult RDA of 1mg/kg body weight/day. However, if the vitamin K content\\nof human milk is assumed to be about 2mg/l, exclusively breast-fed infants\\naged 0–6 months may ingest only 20% of their presumed daily requirement\\nof 5mg (54). Whether a ﬁgure of 5mg/day is itself safe is uncertain. In the\\nUnited Kingdom the dietary reference value for infants is set at 10mg/day,\\nwhich in relation to body weight (2mg/kg) is about double the estimate for\\nadults (65). It was set with reference to the upper end of possible human milk\\nconcentrations plus a further qualitative addition to allow for the absence of\\nhepatic menaquinones in early life and the presumed reliance on dietary\\nvitamin K alone.\\nThe association of VKDB with breastfeeding does not mean that most'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='vitamin K alone.\\nThe association of VKDB with breastfeeding does not mean that most\\ninfants are at risk of developing VKDB, as this is a rare vitamin K deﬁciency\\nsyndrome. In contrast to measurements of PIVKA-II levels, comparisons of\\nvitamin K-dependent clotting activities have shown no detectable differences\\nbetween infants fed human milk and those fed artiﬁcal formula. The detec-\\ntion of PIVKA-II with normal functional levels of vitamin K-dependent\\ncoagulation factors does not imply immediate or even future haemorrhagic\\nrisk for a particular individual. The major value of PIVKA-II measurements\\nin infants is to assess the prevalence of suboptimal vitamin K status in popu-\\nlation studies. However, because of the potential consequences of VKDB, the\\npaediatric profession of most countries agrees that some form of vitamin K\\nsupplementation is necessary even though there are widespread differences in\\nactual practice.\\n6.7.2 Infants (7–12 months), children, and adults\\nIn the past, the requirements for vitamin K have only considered its classical\\nfunction in coagulation; an RDA has been given for vitamin K in the United\\nStates (54, 58) and a safe and adequate intake level given in the United Kingdom\\n(65). In both countries the adult RDA or adequate intake have been set at a\\nvalue of 1mg/kg body weight/day. Thus, in the United States the RDA for a\\n79-kg man is listed as 80mg/day and for a 63-kg woman as 65mg/day (54).\\nAt the time previous recommendations were set there were few data on\\ndietary intakes of vitamin K (mainly phylloquinone) in different populations.\\nThe development of more accurate and wide-ranging food databases is now\\nhelping to redress this information gap. The results of several dietary intake\\nstudies carried out in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that\\nthe average intakes for adults are very close to the respective recommenda-\\ntions of each country.

In the United States, preliminary intake data also\\nsuggest that average intakes of phylloquinone in children and adolescents\\nexceed the RDA; in 6-month-old infants the intakes exceeded the RDA of \\n10mg by nearly eight-fold (40), reﬂecting the use of supplemented formula\\nfoods. Because there is no evidence of even subclinical deﬁciencies of haemo-\\nstatic function, a daily intake of 1mg/kg may still be used as the basis for the\\nrecommended nutrient intake (RNI). There is no basis as yet for making dif-\\nferent recommendations for pregnant and lactating women (Table 6.4).\\nThe question remains whether the RNI should be raised to take into\\naccount recent evidence that the requirements for the optimal carboxylation\\nof vitamin K-dependent proteins in other tissues are greater than those for\\ncoagulation. There is certainly evidence that the g-carboxylation of osteocal-\\ncin can be improved by intakes somewhere between 100 and 420mg/day (62).\\nIf an RNI for vitamin K sufﬁciency is to be deﬁned as that amount necessary\\nfor the optimal carboxylation of all vitamin K-dependent proteins, including\\nosteocalcin, then it seems clear that this RNI would lie somewhere above the\\ncurrent intakes of many, if not most, of the population in the United States\\nand the United Kingdom.

Humans and\\nprimates lack the terminal enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of ascorbic\\nacid, l-gulonolactone oxidase, because the gene encoding for the enzyme has\\nundergone substantial mutation so that no protein is produced (2).\\n7.2 Role of vitamin C in human metabolic processes\\n7.2.1 Background biochemistry\\nVitamin C is an electron donor (reducing agent or antioxidant), and proba-\\nbly all of its biochemical and molecular roles can be accounted for by this\\nfunction. The potentially protective role of vitamin C as an antioxidant is \\ndiscussed in the antioxidants chapter of this report (see Chapter 8).\\n7.2.2 Enzymatic functions\\nVitamin C acts as an electron donor for 11 enzymes (3, 4). Three of those\\nenzymes are found in fungi but not in humans or other mammals (5, 6) and\\nare involved in reutilization pathways for pyrimidines and the deoxyribose\\nmoiety of deoxynucleosides. Of the eight remaining human enzymes, three\\nparticipate in collagen hydroxylation (7–9) and two in carnitine biosynthesis\\n(10, 11); of the three enzymes which participate in collagen hydroxylation,\\none is necessary for biosynthesis of the catecholamine norepinephrine (12,\\n13), one is necessary for amidation of peptide hormones (14, 15), and one is\\ninvolved in tyrosine metabolism (4, 16).\\nAscorbate interacts with enzymes having either monooxygenase or dioxy-\\ngenase activity. The monooxygenases, dopamine b-monooxygenase and \\npeptidyl-glycine a-monooxygenase, incorporate a single oxygen atom into a\\nsubstrate, either a dopamine or a glycine-terminating peptide. The dioxyge-\\nnases incorporate two oxygen atoms in two different ways: the enzyme 4-\\nhydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase incorporates two oxygen atoms into\\none product; the other dioxygenase incorporates one oxygen atom into suc-'),\n",

Schorah et al.\\n(17) found that the concentrations of vitamin C in gastric juice were several-\\nfold higher (median, 249mmol/l; range, 43–909mmol/l) than those found in the\\nplasma of the same normal subjects (median, 39mmol/l; range, 14–101mmol/l).\\nGastric juice vitamin C may prevent the formation of N-nitroso compounds,\\nwhich are potentially mutagenic (18). High intakes of vitamin C correlate with\\nreduced gastric cancer risk (19), but a cause-and-effect relationship has not\\nbeen established. Vitamin C protects low-density lipoproteins ex vivo against\\noxidation and may function similarly in the blood (20) (see Chapter 8).\\nA common feature of vitamin C deﬁciency is anaemia. The antioxidant\\nproperties of vitamin C may stabilize folate in food and in plasma; increased\\nexcretion of oxidized folate derivatives in humans with scurvy has been\\nreported (21). Vitamin C promotes absorption of soluble non-haem iron pos-\\nsibly by chelation or simply by maintaining the iron in the reduced (ferrous,\\nFe2+) form (22, 23). The effect can be achieved with the amounts of vitamin\\nC obtained in foods. However, the amount of dietary vitamin C required to\\nincrease iron absorption ranges from 25mg upwards and depends largely on\\nthe amount of inhibitors, such as phytates and polyphenols, present in the\\nmeal (24). (See Chapter 13 for further discussion.)\\n7.3 Consequences of vitamin C deficiency\\nFrom the 15th century, scurvy was dreaded by seamen and explorers forced\\nto subsist for months on diets of dried beef and biscuits.

The Shefﬁeld studies (26, 27) and the\\nlater studies in Iowa (28, 29) were the ﬁrst major attempts to quantify vitamin\\nC requirements. The studies indicated that the amount of vitamin C required\\nto prevent or cure early signs of deﬁciency is between 6.5 and 10mg/day. This\\nrange represents the lowest physiological requirement. The Iowa studies (28,\\n29) and Kallner et al. (30) established that at tissue saturation, whole-body\\nvitamin C content is approximately 20mg/kg, or 1500mg, and that during\\ndepletion vitamin C is lost at a rate of 3% of whole-body content per day.\\nClinical signs of scurvy appear in men at intakes lower than 10mg/day (27)\\nor when the whole-body content falls below 300mg (28). Such intakes are\\nassociated with plasma ascorbate concentrations below 11mmol/l or leuko-\\ncyte levels less than 2nmol/108 cells.

In\\ngeneral, plasma ascorbate closely reﬂects the dietary intake and ranges\\nbetween 20 and 80mmol/l. During infection or physical trauma, the number\\nof circulating leukocytes increases and these take up vitamin C from the\\nplasma (31, 32). Therefore, both plasma and leukocyte levels may not be very\\nprecise indicators of body content or status at such times. However, leuko-\\ncyte ascorbate remains a better indicator of vitamin C status than plasma\\nascorbate most of the time and only in the period immediately after the onset\\nof an infection are both values unreliable.\\nIntestinal absorption of vitamin C is by an active, sodium-dependent,\\nenergy-requiring, carrier-mediated transport mechanism (33) and as intake\\nincreases, the tissues become progressively more saturated. The physiologi-\\ncally efﬁcient, renal-tubular reabsorption mechanism retains vitamin C in \\nthe tissues up to a whole-body content of ascorbate of about 20mg/kg \\nbody weight (30). However, under steady-state conditions, as intake rises \\nfrom around 100mg/day there is an increase in urinary output so that at \\n1000mg/day almost all absorbed vitamin C is excreted (34, 35).\\n7.4 Populations at risk for vitamin C deficiency\\nThe populations at risk of vitamin C deﬁciency are those for whom the fruit\\nand vegetable supply is minimal.

In Germany and\\nthe United Kingdom, the mean dietary intakes of vitamin C in adult men and\\nwomen were 75 and 72mg/day (36), and 87 and 76mg/day (37), respectively.\\nIn addition, a recent survey of elderly men and women in the United\\nKingdom reported vitamin C intakes of 72 (SD, 61) and 68 (SD, 60)mg/day,\\nrespectively (39).

In all of these studies there was a wide variation in vitamin C\\nintake. In the United States 25–30% of the population consumed less than 2.5\\nservings of fruit and vegetables daily.

The WHO goal has been roughly translated into\\nthe recommendation of ﬁve portions of fruits and vegetables per day (42).\\nReports from India show that the available supply of vitamin C is \\n43mg/capita/day, and in the different states of India it ranges from 27 to \\n66mg/day.

Citrus fruits and juices\\nare particularly rich sources of vitamin C but other fruits including cantaloupe\\nand honeydew melons, cherries, kiwi fruits, mangoes, papaya, strawberries,\\ntangelo, tomatoes, and water melon also contain variable amounts of vitamin\\nC. Vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, bean sprouts, cau-\\nliﬂower, kale, mustard greens, red and green peppers, peas, and potatoes may\\nbe more important sources of vitamin C than fruits, given that the vegetable\\nsupply often extends for longer periods during the year than does the fruit\\nsupply.\\nIn many developing countries, the supply of vitamin C is often determined\\nby seasonal factors (i.e. the availability of water, time, and labour for the man-\\nagement of household gardens and the short harvesting season of many fruits).\\nFor example, mean monthly ascorbate intakes ranged from 0 to 115mg/day\\nin one Gambian community in which peak intakes coincided with the sea-\\nsonal duration of the mango crop and to a lesser extent with orange and grape-\\nfruit harvests. These ﬂuctuations in dietary ascorbate intake were closely\\nreﬂected by corresponding variations in plasma ascorbate (11.4–68.4mmol/l)\\nand human milk ascorbate (143–342mmol/l) (76).\\nVitamin C is very labile, and the loss of vitamin C on boiling milk \\nprovides one dramatic example of a cause of infantile scurvy.

In contrast, heating\\nand exposure to copper or iron or to mildly alkaline conditions destroys the\\nvitamin, and too much water can leach it from the tissues during cooking.\\nIt is important to realize that the amount of vitamin C in a food is usually\\nnot the major determinant of a food’s importance for supply, but rather reg-\\nularity of intake. For example, in countries where the potato is an important\\nstaple food and refrigeration facilities are limited, seasonal variations in plasma\\nascorbate are due to the considerable deterioration in the potato’s vitamin C\\ncontent during storage; the content can decrease from 30 to 8mg/100g over\\n8–9 months (77). Such data illustrate the important contribution the potato\\ncan make to human vitamin C requirements even though the potato’s vitamin\\nC concentration is low.\\nAn extensive study has been made of losses of vitamin C during the pack-\\naging, storage, and cooking of blended foods (i.e. maize and soya-based relief\\nfoods). Data from a United States international development programme\\nshow that vitamin C losses from packaging and storage in polythene bags of\\nsuch relief foods are much less signiﬁcant than the 52–82% losses attributa-\\nble to conventional cooking procedures (78).\\n7.6 Evidence used to derive recommended intakes of\\nvitamin C\\n7.6.1 Adults\\nAt saturation the whole body content of ascorbate in adult males is approx-\\nimately 20mg/kg, or 1500mg.

Below intakes of 30mg/day, plasma concentrations are\\naround 11mmol/l. Above this intake, plasma concentrations increase steeply\\nto 60mmol/l and plateau at around 80mmol/l, which represents the renal\\nthreshold. Under near steady-state conditions, plateau concentrations of\\nvitamin C are achieved by intakes in excess of 200mg/day (Figure 7.1) (34).\\n7. VITAMIN C\\n135\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n136\\nAt low doses dietary vitamin C is almost completely absorbed, but over the\\nrange of usual dietary intakes (30–180mg/day), absorption may decrease to\\n75% because of competing factors in the food (35, 80).\\nA body content of 900mg falls halfway between tissue saturation (1500mg)\\nand the point at which clinical signs of scurvy appear (300–400mg). Assum-\\ning an absorption efﬁciency of 85%, and a catabolic rate of 2.9%, the average\\nintake of vitamin C can be calculated as:\\n900 ¥ 2.9/100 ¥ 100/85 = 30.7 mg/day.\\nThis value can be rounded to 30mg/day.

Dietary antioxidants\\n145\\n8.1 Nutrients with an antioxidant role\\nThe potential beneﬁcial effects of antioxidants in protecting against disease\\nhave been used as an argument for recommending increasing intakes of several\\nnutrients above those derived by conventional methods. If it is possible to\\nquantify such claims, antioxidant properties should be considered in decisions\\nconcerning the daily requirements of these nutrients.

In addi-\\ntion, pro-oxidant metabolism and the importance of iron are also considered.\\nMembers of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research\\nCouncil in the United States recently deﬁned a dietary antioxidant as a sub-\\nstance in foods which signiﬁcantly decreases the adverse effects of reactive\\noxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, or both on normal physiological\\nfunction in humans (1). It is recognized that this deﬁnition is somewhat\\nnarrow because maintenance of membrane stability is also a feature of anti-\\noxidant function (2) and an important antioxidant function of both vitamin\\nA (3) and zinc (4). However, it was decided to restrict consideration of anti-\\noxidant function in this document to nutrients which were likely to interact\\nmore directly with reactive species.\\n8.2 The need for biological antioxidants\\nIt is now well established that free radicals, especially superoxide (O2.-), nitric\\noxide (NO.), and other reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),\\nare continuously produced in vivo (5–7). Superoxide in particular is produced\\nby leakage from the electron transport chains within the mitochondria and\\nmicrosomal P450 systems (8) or formed more deliberately, for example, by\\nactivated phagocytes as part of the primary immune defence in response to\\nforeign substances or to combat infection by microorganisms (9). Nitric oxide\\nis produced from l-arginine by nitric oxide synthases, and these enzymes are\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n146\\nfound in virtually every tissue of the mammalian body, albeit at widely dif-\\nferent levels (7).

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='a beneﬁcial metabolite and indeed it may react with lipid peroxides and func-\\ntion as an antioxidant (10). Nitric oxide also serves as a mediator whereby\\nmacrophages express cytotoxic activity against microorganisms and neoplas-\\ntic cells (11). If nitric oxide is at a sufﬁciently high concentration, it can react\\nrapidly with superoxide in the absence of a catalyst to form peroxynitrite.\\nPeroxynitrite is a potentially damaging nitrogen species which can react\\nthrough several different mechanisms, including the formation of an inter-\\nmediate through a reaction with a hydroxyl radical (12).\\nTo cope with potentially damaging reactive oxidant species (ROS), aerobic\\ntissues contain endogenously produced antioxidant enzymes such as super-\\noxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase as well as\\nseveral exogenously acquired radical-scavenging substances such as vitamins\\nE and C and the carotenoids (13). Under normal conditions, the high con-\\ncentrations of SOD maintain superoxide concentrations at a level too low to\\nallow the formation of peroxynitrite. It is also important to mention the antiox-\\nidant, reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH is ubiquitous in aerobic tissues, and\\nalthough it is not a nutrient, it is synthesized from sulfhydryl-containing amino\\nacids and is highly important in intermediary antioxidant metabolism (14).\\nIntegrated antioxidant defences protect tissues and are presumably in equi-\\nlibrium with continuously generated ROS to maintain tissues metabolically\\nintact most of the time. Disturbances to the system occur when production\\nof ROS is rapidly increased, for example, by excessive exercise, high exposure\\nto xenobiotic compounds (such as an anaesthetic, pollutants, or unusual food),\\ninfection, or trauma.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='oxidase, which follows ischaemia. The degree of damage resulting from the\\ntemporary imbalance depends on the ability of the antioxidant systems to\\nrespond to the oxidant or pro-oxidant load. Fruits and vegetables are good\\nsources of many antioxidants, and it is reported that diets rich in these foods\\nare associated with a lower risk of the chronic diseases of cancer (15) and heart\\ndisease (16). Hence, it is believed that a healthful diet maintains the exoge-\\nnous antioxidants at or near optimal levels thus reducing the risk of tissue\\ndamage. The most prominent representatives of dietary antioxidants are\\nvitamin C, tocopherols, carotenoids, and ﬂavonoids (17–19). Requirements\\nfor ﬂavonoids are not being considered at this time, as work on this subject\\nis still very much in its infancy. In contrast, several intervention studies have\\nbeen carried out to determine whether supplements of the other nutrients can\\nprovide additional beneﬁts against diseases such as those mentioned above.\\nThe components of biological tissues are an ideal mixture of substrates \\nfor oxidation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), transition metals, and\\noxygen are present in abundance but are prevented from reaction by cellular\\norganization and structure. PUFAs are present in membranes but are always\\nfound with vitamin E. Transition metals, particularly iron, are bound to both\\ntransport and storage proteins; abundant binding sites on such proteins\\nprevent overloading the protein molecule with metal ions. Tissue structures,\\nhowever, break down during inﬂammation and disease, and free iron and\\nother transition metals have been detected during these periods (20, 21).\\nPotentially damaging metabolites can arise from interactions between tran-\\nsition metals and the ROS described above. In particular, the highly reactive\\nhydroxyl radical can be formed by the Fenton (reaction 1) and Haber-Weiss\\nreactions (reaction 2; with an iron-salt catalyst) (22). Pathologic conditions'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='reactions (reaction 2; with an iron-salt catalyst) (22). Pathologic conditions\\ngreatly increase the concentrations of both superoxide and nitric oxide, and\\nthe formation of peroxynitrite has been demonstrated in macrophages, neu-\\ntrophils, and cultured endothelium (reaction 3) (12, 23).\\nDuring inﬂammation or other forms of stress and disease, the body adopts\\nnew measures to counter potential pro-oxidant damage. The body alters \\nthe transport and distribution of iron by blocking iron mobilization and\\nabsorption, and stimulating iron uptake from plasma by liver, spleen, and\\nmacrophages (3, 24, 25). Nitric oxide has been shown to play a role in the\\ncoordination of iron trafﬁc by mimicking the consequences of iron starvation\\nand leading to the cellular uptake of iron (26). The changes accompanying\\ndisease are generally termed the acute-phase response and are, generally, pro-\\ntective (27). Some of the changes in plasma acute-phase reactants which affect\\niron at the onset of disease or trauma are shown in Table 8.1.\\n8.3 Pro-oxidant activity of biological antioxidants\\nMost biological antioxidants are antioxidants because when they accept an\\nunpaired electron, the free radical intermediate formed has a relatively long\\nhalf-life in the normal biological environment. The long half-life means that\\nthese intermediates remain stable for long enough to interact in a controlled\\nfashion with other intermediates which prevent autoxidation, and the excess\\nenergy of the surplus electron is dissipated without damage to the tissues.\\nThus it is believed that the tocopheroxyl radical formed by oxidation of \\na-tocopherol is sufﬁciently stable to enable its reduction by vitamin C or\\nReaction 1:\\nFe\\nH O\\nFe\\nOH\\nOH\\nReaction 2:\\nO\\nH O\\nO\\nOH\\nOH\\nReaction 3:\\nNO\\nO\\nONOO\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n+\\n+\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n+\\n=\\n+\\n◊+\\n◊+\\n=\\n+\\n◊+\\n+\\n◊=\\n◊\\n8.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='on oxygen tension and concentration (33, 34). At low oxygen tension b-\\ncarotene acts as a chain-breaking antioxidant whereas at high oxygen tension\\nit readily autoxidizes and exhibits pro-oxidant behaviour (33). Palozza (34)\\nhas reviewed much of the evidence and has suggested that b-carotene has\\nantioxidant activity between 2 and 20mmHg of oxygen tension, but at the\\noxygen tension in air or above (>150mmHg) it is much less effective as an\\nantioxidant and can show pro-oxidant activity as the oxygen tension increases.\\nPalozza (34) also suggested that autoxidation reactions of b-carotene may be\\ncontrolled by the presence of other antioxidants (e.g. vitamins E and C) or\\nother carotenoids. There is some evidence that intake of large quantities of\\nfat-soluble nutrients such as b-carotene and other carotenoids may cause them\\nto compete with each other during absorption and lower plasma concentra-\\ntions of other nutrients derived from the diet. However, a lack of other antiox-\\nidants is unlikely to explain the increased incidence of lung cancer that was\\nobserved in a a-tocopherol/b-carotene intervention study, because there was\\nno difference in cancer incidence between the group which received both b-\\ncarotene and a-tocopherol and the groups which received one treatment only\\n(35).\\nThe free radical formed from a dietary antioxidant is potentially a pro-\\noxidant as is any other free radical. In biological conditions that deviate from\\nthe norm, there is always the potential for an antioxidant free radical to\\nbecome a pro-oxidant if a suitable receptor molecule is present to accept the\\nelectron and promote the autoxidation (36).

Vitamin C is water-soluble and is therefore\\nespecially found in the aqueous fractions of the cell and in body ﬂuids whereas\\nvitamin E is highly lipophilic and is found in membranes and lipoproteins.\\n8.5.1 Vitamin E\\nVitamin E falls into the class of conventional antioxidants which generally\\nconsist of phenols or aromatic amines (see Chapter 5). In the case of the four\\ntocopherols that, together with the four tocotrienols constitute vitamin E, the\\ninitial step involves a very rapid transfer of phenolic hydrogen to the recipi-\\nent free radical with the formation of a phenoxyl radical from vitamin E. The\\nphenoxyl radical is resonance stabilized and is relatively unreactive towards\\nlipid or oxygen. It does not therefore continue the chain (33, 46). However,\\nthe phenoxyl radical is no longer an antioxidant and to maintain the antioxi-\\ndant properties of membranes, it must be recycled or repaired (i.e. reconverted\\nto vitamin E) because the amount of vitamin E present in membranes can \\nbe several thousand-fold less than the amount of potentially oxidizable sub-\\nstrate (47). Water-soluble vitamin C is the popular candidate for this role (31),\\nbut thiols and particularly GSH can also function in this role in vitro (32,\\n48–50).\\nThere are eight possible isomers of vitamin E, but a-tocopherol (5,7,8-\\ntrimethyltocol) is the most biologically important antioxidant in vivo (46). In\\nplasma samples, more than 90% is present as a-tocopherol but there may be\\napproximately 10% of g-tocopherol.

Within biological membranes, vitamin E is believed to intercalate with\\nphospholipids and provide protection to PUFAs. PUFAs are particularly \\nsusceptible to free radical-mediated oxidation because of their methylene-\\ninterrupted double-bond structure. The amount of PUFAs in the membrane\\nfar exceeds the amount of vitamin E, and the tocopherol–PUFA ratios are\\nhighest in tissues where oxygen exposure is greatest and not necessarily where\\nthe PUFA content is highest (47).\\nOxidation of PUFAs leads to disturbances in membrane structure and\\nfunction and is damaging to cell function. Vitamin E is highly efﬁcient at pre-\\nventing the autoxidation of lipid and it appears that its primary, and possibly\\nonly, role in biological tissues is to perform this function (46). Autoxidation\\nof lipid is initiated by a free radical abstracting hydrogen from PUFA to form\\na lipid radical (reaction 6), which is followed by a rearrangement of the\\ndouble-bond structure to form a conjugated diene. In vitro the presence of\\nminute amounts of peroxides and transition metals will stimulate the forma-\\ntion of the initial radical. Oxygen adds to the lipid radical to form a lipid per-\\noxide (reaction 7), which then reacts with another lipid molecule to form a\\nhydroperoxide and a new lipid radical (reaction 8).

For example, the consequences of scurvy, such as\\nthe breakdown of connective tissue ﬁbres (51) and muscular weakness (52),\\nare both linked to hydroxylation reactions in which ascorbate maintains\\nloosely bound iron in the ferrous form to prevent its oxidation to the ferric\\nform, which makes the hydroxylase enzymes inactive (53). Ascorbate exhibits\\nsimilar redox functions in catecholamine biosynthesis (53) and in microsomal\\ncytochrome P450 enzyme activity, although the latter may only be important\\nin young animals (54). In the eye, vitamin C concentrations may be 50 times\\nhigher than in the plasma and may protect against the oxidative damage of\\nlight (55). Vitamin C is also present in the gonads, where it may play a criti-\\ncal role in sperm maturation (56). Spermatogenesis involves many more cell\\ndivisions than does oogenesis, resulting in an increased risk of mutation. \\nFraga et al. (57) reported that levels of sperm oxidized by nucleoside'),\n",

When blood\\nplasma is separated from erythrocytes, vitamin C is the ﬁrst antioxidant to\\ndisappear.\\nVitamin C is a powerful antioxidant because it can donate a hydrogen atom\\nand form a relatively stable ascorbyl free radical (i.e. L-ascorbate anion, see\\nFigure 8.1). As a scavenger of ROS, ascorbate has been shown to be effective\\nagainst the superoxide radical anion, hydrogen peroxide, the hydroxyl radical,\\nand singlet oxygen (59, 60). Vitamin C also scavenges reactive nitrogen oxide\\nspecies to prevent nitrosation of target molecules (61). The ascorbyl free\\nradical can be converted back to reduced ascorbate by accepting another\\nhydrogen atom or it can undergo further oxidation to dehydroascorbate.\\nDehydroascorbate is unstable but is more fat soluble than ascorbate and is\\ntaken up 10–20 times more rapidly by erythrocytes, where it will be reduced\\nback to ascorbate by GSH or NADPH from the hexose monophosphate\\nshunt (56).\\nThus, mechanisms exist to recycle vitamin C, which are similar to those\\nfor vitamin E. The existence of a mechanism to maintain plasma ascorbate in\\nthe reduced state means that the level of vitamin C necessary for optimal\\nantioxidant activity is not absolute because the turnover will change in\\n8.

There are approximately 50 carotenoids with\\nprovitamin A activity, but b-carotene is the most important and is one of \\nthe most widely distributed carotenoids in plant species (64). Approximately\\n2–6mg b-carotene is consumed by adults daily in developed countries (65,\\n66), probably along with similar amounts of lutein (67) and lycopene (66).\\nSmaller amounts may be consumed in the developing world (68, 69). Con-\\nsumption of b-cryptoxanthin, a provitamin A carotenoid found mainly in\\nfruits (66), is small, but as bioavailability of carotenoids may be greater from\\nfruits than from vegetables, its contribution to dietary intake and vitamin A\\nstatus may be higher than the amount in the diet would predict.\\nb-Carotene has two six-membered carbon rings (b-ionone rings) separated\\nby 18 carbon atoms in the form of a conjugated chain of double bonds. \\nb-Carotene is unique in possessing two b-ionone rings in its structure, both\\nOH\\nOH\\nHOCH\\nO\\nCH2OH\\nCH2OH\\nH\\nL-ascorbic acid\\nOH\\nO– \\nHOCH\\nO\\nH\\nL-ascorbate anion\\n–H+\\n+H+\\n+e\\n–e\\nO\\nO\\nFIGURE 8.1\\nAscorbic acid and its oxidation products'),\n",

The antioxidant properties of the\\ncarotenoids closely relate to the extended system of conjugated double bonds,\\nwhich occupies the central part of carotenoid molecules, and to the various\\nfunctional groups on the terminal ring structures (33, 70, 71). The reactive\\noxidant species scavenged by carotenoids are singlet oxygen and peroxyl rad-\\nicals (33, 72–74). Carotenoids in general and lycopene speciﬁcally are very\\nefﬁcient at quenching singlet oxygen (72, 73). In this process the carotenoid\\nabsorbs the excess energy from singlet oxygen and then releases it as heat.\\nSinglet oxygen is generated during photosynthesis; therefore, carotenoids are\\nimportant for protecting plant tissues, but there is some evidence for an\\nantioxidant role in humans. b-Carotene has been used in the treatment of ery-\\nthropoietic protoporphyria (75) (a light-sensitive condition) with amounts in\\nexcess of 180mg/day (76).

It has also been suggested that because the\\ncarotenoid molecule is long enough to span the bilayer lipid membrane (83),\\nthe presence of oxy functional groups on the ring structures may facilitate\\nsimilar reactivation of the carotenoid radical in a manner similar to that of the\\nphenoxyl radical of vitamin E (33).\\nThere is some evidence for an antioxidant role for b-carotene in immune\\ncells.

These \\nmanifestations have now declined, the decline being brought about not\\nthrough programmes which distribute synthetic vitamins but through \\nchanges in the patterns of food availability and consequent changes in dietary\\npractices.\\nAlthough many clinical manifestations of B-vitamin deﬁciencies have\\ndecreased, there is evidence of widespread subclinical deﬁciency of these vita-\\nmins (especially of riboﬂavin and pyridoxine).

These subclinical deﬁciencies,\\nalthough less dramatic in their manifestations, exert deleterious metabolic\\neffects. Despite the progress in reduction of large-scale deﬁciency in the\\nworld, there are periodic reports of outbreaks of B-complex deﬁciencies\\nwhich are linked to deﬁcits of B vitamins in populations under various dis-\\ntress conditions.\\nRefugee and displaced population groups (20 million people by current\\nUnited Nations estimates) are at risk for B-complex deﬁciency because most\\ncereal foods used under emergency situations are not fortiﬁed with micronu-\\ntrients (1). Recent reports have implicated the low B-complex content of diets\\nas a factor in the outbreak of peripheral neuropathy and visual loss observed\\nin the adult population of Cuba (2–4). This deﬁciency in Cuba resulted from\\nthe consequences of an economic blockade (4).\\nBecause of the extensive literature pertaining to the study of the B-complex\\nvitamins, the references cited here have been limited to those published after\\nthe publication of the 1974 edition of the FAO/WHO Handbook on human\\nnutritional requirements (5). Greater weight has been given to studies which\\nused larger numbers of subjects over longer periods, more thoroughly\\nassessed dietary intake, varied the level of the speciﬁc vitamin being investi-\\ngated, and used multiple indicators, including those considered functional in\\nthe assessment of status. These indicators have been the main basis for ascer-\\ntaining requirements. Although extensive, the bibliographic search of recently\\npublished reports presented in this chapter most likely underestimates the\\nextent of B-complex deﬁciency given that many cases are not reported in the\\nmedical literature.

In relatively industrialized nations, the neu-\\nrologic manifestations of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome are frequently asso-\\nciated with chronic alcoholism in conjunction with limited food consumption\\n(9). Some cases of thiamine deﬁciency have been observed with patients who\\nare hypermetabolic, are on parenteral nutrition, are undergoing chronic renal\\ndialysis, or have undergone a gastrectomy. Thiamine deﬁciency has also \\nbeen observed in Nigerians who ate silk worms, Russian schoolchildren\\n(Moscow), Thai rural elderly, Cubans, Japanese elderly, Brazilian Xavante\\nIndians, French Guyanese, south-east Asian schoolchildren who were\\ninfected with hookworm, Malaysian detention inmates, and people with\\nchronic alcoholism.\\nToxicity\\nThiamine toxicity is not a problem because renal clearance of the vitamin is\\nrapid.\\nRole in human metabolic processes\\nThiamine functions as the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in the\\nmetabolism of carbohydrates and branched-chain amino acids. Speciﬁcally\\nthe Mg2+-coordinated TPP participates in the formation of a-ketols (e.g.\\namong hexose and pentose phosphates) as catalysed by transketolase and in\\nthe oxidation of a-keto acids (e.g. pyruvate, a-ketoglutarate, and branched-\\nchain a-keto acids) by dehydrogenase complexes (10, 11). Hence, when there\\nis insufﬁcient thiamine, the overall decrease in carbohydrate metabolism and\\nits interconnection with amino acid metabolism (via a-keto acids) has severe\\nconsequences, such as a decrease in the formation of acetylcholine for neural\\nfunction.\\n9.2.2 Biochemical indicators\\nIndicators used to estimate thiamine requirements are urinary excretion, ery-\\nthrocyte transketolase activity coefﬁcient, erythrocyte thiamine, blood pyru-\\nvate and lactate, and neurologic changes.

Erythrocyte transketolase activity coef-\\nﬁcient reﬂects TPP levels and can indicate rare genetic defects. Erythrocyte\\nthiamine is mainly a direct measure of TPP but when combined with high\\nperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation can also provide a\\nmeasure of thiamine and thiamine monophosphate.\\nThiamine status has been assessed by measuring urinary thiamine excretion\\nunder basal conditions or after thiamine loading; transketolase activity; and\\nfree and phosphorylated forms in blood or serum (6, 9). Although overlap\\nwith baseline values for urinary thiamine was found with oral doses below \\n1mg, a correlation of 0.86 between oral and excreted amounts was found by\\nBayliss et al. (12). The erythrocyte transketolase assay, in which an activity\\ncoefﬁcient based on a TPP stimulation of the basal level is given, continues\\nto be a main functional indicator (9), but some problems have been encoun-\\ntered. Gans and Harper (13) found a wide range of TPP effects when thiamine\\nintakes were adequate (i.e. above 1.5mg/day over a 3-day period). In some\\ncases, the activity coefﬁcient may appear normal after prolonged deﬁciency\\n(14). This measure seemed poorly correlated with dietary intakes estimated\\nfor a group of English adolescents (15). Certainly, there are both interindi-\\nvidual and genetic factors affecting the transketolase (16). Baines and Davies\\n(17) suggested that it is useful to determine erythrocyte TPP directly because \\nthe coenzyme is less susceptible to factors that inﬂuence enzyme activity;\\nthere are also methods for determining thiamine and its phosphate esters in\\nwhole blood (18).\\n9.2.3 Factors affecting requirements\\nBecause thiamine facilitates energy utilization, its requirements have tradi-\\ntionally been expressed on the basis of energy intake, which can vary depend-'),\n",

Also, a study with\\nthiamine-restricted Dutch males whose intake averaged 0.43mg/day for 11\\nweeks did not reveal an association between short bouts of intense exercise\\nand decreases in indicators of thiamine status (20). Alcohol consumption may\\ninterfere with thiamine absorption as well (9).\\n9.2.4 Evidence used to derive recommended intakes\\nRecommendations for infants are based on adequate food intake.

The\\nblood concentration for total thiamine averages 210 ± 53nmol/l for infants up\\nto 6 months but decreases over the ﬁrst 12–18 months of life (22).\\nA study of 13–14-year-old children related dietary intake of thiamine to\\nseveral indicators of thiamine status (15).

If a deﬁciency occurs, it is usually\\naccompanied by deﬁcits of other nutrients. The use of experimental animals,\\nan antagonistic analogue (w-methylpantothenate) given to humans, and more\\nrecently, the feeding of semi-synthetic diets virtually free of pantothenate\\n(102), have all helped to deﬁne signs and symptoms of deﬁciency.

Some cases of pantothenate deﬁciency have been observed in patients\\nwith acne and other dermatitic conditions.\\nToxicity\\nToxicity is not a problem with pantothenate, as no adverse effects have been\\nobserved (6).\\nRole in human metabolic processes\\nPantothenic acid is a component of CoA, a cofactor that carries acyl groups\\nfor many enzymatic processes, and of phosphopantetheine within acyl carrier\\nproteins, a component of the fatty acid synthase complex (10, 11). The \\ncompounds containing pantothenate are most especially involved in fatty acid\\nmetabolism and the pantothenate-containing prosthetic group additionally\\nfacilitates binding with appropriate enzymes.\\n9.6.2 Biochemical indicators\\nIndicators used to estimate pantothenate requirements are urinary excretion\\nand blood levels. Excretion rate reﬂects intake. Whole blood, which contains\\nthe vitamin itself and pantothenate-containing metabolites, has a general cor-\\nrelation with intake; erythrocyte levels, however, seem more meaningful than\\nplasma or serum levels.\\nRelative correspondence to pantothenate status has been reported for\\nurinary excretion and for blood content of both whole blood and erythro-\\ncytes (6, 9). Fry et al. (102) reported a decline in urinary pantothenate levels\\nfrom approximately 3 to 0.8mg/day (13.7–3.6mmol/day) in young men fed a\\ndeﬁcient diet for 84 days. Urinary excretion for a typical American diet was\\nfound to be 2.6mg/day (12mmol/day) (79). Pantothenate intake estimated for\\nadolescents was signiﬁcantly correlated with pantothenate in urine (103).\\nWhole-blood pantothenate fell from 1.95 to 1.41mg/ml (8.8 to 6.4mmol/l)\\nwhen six adult males were fed a pantothenate-free diet (102).

There is an excellent\\ncorrelation of whole-blood concentrations of pantothenate with the erythro-\\ncyte con-centration, with an average value being 334ng/ml (1.5mmol/l) (103).\\nThe lack of sufﬁcient population data, however, suggests the current use of\\nan adequate intake rather than a recommended intake as a suitable basis for \\nrecommendations.\\n9.6.3 Factors affecting requirements\\nA measurement of urinary excretion of pantothenate after feeding a \\nformula diet containing both bound and free vitamin indicates that \\napproximately 50% of the pantothenate present in natural foods may be\\nbioavailable (79).\\n9.6.4 Evidence used to derive recommended intakes\\nInfant requirements are based on an estimation of the pantothenic \\nacid content of human milk, which according to reported values is at least \\n2.2mg/l (21, 105). For a reported average human-milk intake of 0.75l/day\\n(106–108) these values suggest that 1.7mg/day is an adequate intake by\\nyounger (0–6 months) infants. Taking into consideration growth and \\nbody size, 1.8mg/day may be extrapolated for older (7–12 months) infants\\n(105).\\nThe studies of Eissenstat et al. (103) of adolescents suggest that intakes \\nof less than 4mg/day were sufﬁcient to maintain blood and urinary pan-\\ntothenate. Kathman and Kies (109) found a range of pantothenate intake of \\n4mg/day to approximately 8mg/day in 12 adolescents who were 11–16 years\\nold. The usual pantothenate intake for American adults has been reported \\nto be 4–7mg/day (102, 109–111). Hence, around 5mg/day is apparently \\nadequate.\\nFor pregnancy, there is only one relatively recent study that found lower\\nblood pantothenate levels but no difference in urinary excretion in pregnant\\nwomen compared with non-pregnant controls (112).\\nDuring lactation, blood pantothenate concentrations were found to be'),\n",

Biotin\\ndeﬁciency has also been observed in cases of parenteral nutrition with solu-\\ntions lacking biotin given to patients with short-gut syndrome and other\\ncauses of malabsorption (9, 113, 114). Some cases of biotin deﬁciency have\\nbeen noted in infants with intractable nappy dermatitis and in those fed special\\nformulas. Dietary deﬁciency in otherwise normal people is probably rare.\\nSome patients have multiple carboxylase deﬁciencies and there are occasional\\nbiotinidase deﬁciencies. Clinical signs of deﬁciency include dermatitis of an\\nerythematous and seborrheic type; conjunctivitis; alopecia; and central\\nnervous system abnormalities such as hypotonia, lethargy, and developmen-\\ntal delay in infants, and depression, hallucinations, and paresthesia of the\\nextremities in adults.\\nToxicity\\nToxicity is not a problem because of the limited intestinal absorption of biotin.\\nRole in human metabolic processes'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Role in human metabolic processes\\nBiotin functions as a coenzyme within several carboxylases after its carboxyl\\nfunctional group becomes amide linked to the e-amino of speciﬁc lysyl\\nresidues of the apoenzymes (10, 11). In humans and other mammals, biotin\\noperates within four carboxylases. Three of the four biotin-dependent car-\\nboxylases are mitochondrial (pyruvate carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA\\ncarboxylase, and propionyl-CoA carboxylase) whereas the fourth (acetyl-\\nCoA carboxylase) is found in both mitochondria and the cytosol. In all these\\ncases, biotin serves as a carrier for the transfer of active bicarbonate into a \\nsubstrate to generate a carboxyl product.\\n9.7.2 Biochemical indicators\\nIndicators used to estimate biotin requirements are urinary excretion of biotin\\nand excretion of 3-hydroxyisovalerate. The excretion rate of the vitamin \\nand its metabolites in urine is assessed by avidin-based radioimmunoassay\\nwith HPLC. Excretion of 3-hydroxyisovalerate inversely reﬂects the activity\\nof b-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, which is involved in leucine \\nmetabolism.\\nBoth indicators, urinary excretion of biotin as assessed with an avidin-based\\nradioimmunoassay with HPLC, and 3-hydroxyisovalerate excretion have\\nbeen used to assess status (115). The isolation and chemical identiﬁcation of\\nmore than a dozen metabolites of biotin established the main features of its\\nfunction in microbes and mammals (116, 117). Zempleni et al. have quanti-\\nﬁed the major biotin metabolites (118). Both biotin and bis-norbiotin excre-\\ntions were found to decline in parallel in individuals on a diet containing raw\\negg whites (115). In these individuals the levels of urinary 3-hydroxyiso-\\nvalerate, which increase as a result of decreased activity of b-methylcrotonyl-\\nCoA carboxylase and altered leucine metabolism, rose from a normal mean\\nof 112 to 272mmol/24 hours.

Selenium\\n10.1 Role of selenium in human metabolic processes\\nOur understanding of the signiﬁcance of selenium in the nutrition of human\\nsubjects has grown rapidly during the past 20 years (1, 2). Demonstrations of\\nits essentiality to rats and farm animals were followed by appreciation that\\nthe development of selenium-responsive diseases often reﬂected the distribu-\\ntion of geochemical variables which restricted the entry of the element from\\nsoils into food chains. Such ﬁndings were the stimulus to in-depth investiga-\\ntions of the regional relevance of selenium in human nutrition (3). These\\nstudies have now yielded an increased understanding of the complex meta-\\nbolic role of this trace nutrient. Selenium has been implicated in the protec-\\ntion of body tissues against oxidative stress, maintenance of defences against\\ninfection, and modulation of growth and development.\\nThe selenium content of normal adult humans can vary widely. Values from\\n3mg in New Zealanders to 14mg in some Americans reﬂect the profound\\ninﬂuence of the natural environment on the selenium contents of soils, crops,\\nand human tissues. Approximately 30% of tissue selenium is contained in the\\nliver, 15% in kidney, 30% in muscle, and 10% in blood plasma. Much of tissue\\nselenium is found in proteins as selenoanalogues of sulfur amino acids; other\\nmetabolically active forms include selenotrisulphides and other acid-labile\\nselenium compounds. At least 15 selenoproteins have now been characterized.\\nExamples are given in Table 10.1.\\nFunctionally, there appear to be at least two distinct families of selenium-\\ncontaining enzymes. The ﬁrst includes the glutathione peroxidases (4) and\\nthioredoxin reductase (5), which are involved in controlling tissue concen-\\ntrations of highly reactive oxygen-containing metabolites. These meta-\\nbolites are essential at low concentrations for maintaining cell-mediated'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='bolites are essential at low concentrations for maintaining cell-mediated\\nimmunity against infections but highly toxic if produced in excess. The role\\nof selenium in the cytosolic enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), was\\nﬁrst illustrated in 1973. During stress, infection, or tissue injury, selenoen-\\nzymes may protect against the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide or\\noxygen-rich free radicals. This family of enzymes catalyses the destruction of\\nhydrogen peroxide or lipid hydroperoxides according to the following general\\nreactions:\\nwhere GSH is glutathione and GSSG is its oxidized form. At least four forms\\nof GSHPx exist; they differ both in their tissue distribution and in their sen-\\nsitivity to selenium depletion (4). The GSHPx enzymes of liver and blood\\nplasma fall in activity rapidly at early stages of selenium deﬁciency. In con-\\ntrast, a form of GSHPx associated speciﬁcally with phospholipid-rich tissue\\nmembranes is preserved against selenium deﬁciency and is believed to have\\nbroader metabolic roles (e.g. in prostaglandin synthesis) (6). In concert with\\nvitamin E, selenium is also involved in the protection of cell membranes\\nagainst oxidative damage. (See also Chapter 8 on antioxidants.)\\nThe selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase is involved in disposal of the\\nproducts of oxidative metabolism (5). It contains two selenocysteine groups\\nper molecule and is a major component of a redox system with a multiplicity\\nof functions, among which is the capacity to degrade locally excessive and\\npotentially toxic concentrations of peroxide and hydroperoxides likely to\\ninduce cell death and tissue atrophy (6).\\nAnother group of selenoproteins are the iodothyronine deiodinases essen-\\ntial for the conversion of thyrocin or tetraiodothyronine (T4) to its physio-\\nlogically active form tri-iodothyronine (T3) (7).

The consequences of a\\nlow selenium status on physiologic responses to a shortage of iodine are\\ncomplex. The inﬂuence of a loss of selenium-dependent iodothyronine deio-\\ndinase differs in its severity depending on whether a target tissue needs a pre-\\nformed supply of T3 (e.g. via plasma) or whether, as with the brain, pituitary\\ngland, and placenta, it can rely upon local synthesis of T3 from T4. Despite\\nthis, marked changes in the T3–T4 ratio as a consequence of a reduced sele-\\nnium status (when iodine supplies are also marginal) indicate the modifying\\ninﬂuence of selenium on thyroid hormone balance in both animal models and\\nhuman subjects. The possible signiﬁcance of this can be anticipated from the\\nfact that whereas thyroid weights increase typically by 50% in rats offered an\\niodine-deﬁcient diet, thyroid weight is increased 154% by diets concurrently\\ndeﬁcient in both selenium and iodine (see also section 10.2.5).\\nBetween 60% and 80% of selenium in human plasma is accounted for by\\na well-characterized fraction designated selenoprotein P, the function of'),\n",

It is thought to be a selenium storage protein\\nbecause there is limited evidence that it also has an antioxidant role. At least\\n10 other selenoproteins exist, including one which is a component of the mito-\\nchondrial capsule of sperm cells, damage to which may account for the devel-\\nopment of sperm abnormalities during selenium deﬁciency. Other aspects of\\nthe function and metabolism of selenium are reviewed elsewhere (8, 9).\\n10.2 Selenium deficiency\\n10.2.1 Non-endemic deficiencies of selenium\\nBiochemical evidence of selenium depletion (e.g. a decline in blood GSHPx\\nactivity) is not uncommon in subjects maintained on parenteral or enteral\\nfeeding for long periods (10, 11). Low selenium contents of some infant for-\\nmulae have been reported to reduce infant serum selenium and GSHPx values\\nto levels down to one ﬁfth of normal in 5–8-month-old infants (12, 13). The\\nlow selenium content of many older infant formulae would have not only\\nbeen insufﬁcient to meet infant requirements (12) but when used to supple-\\nment breast milk would have diluted the total selenium intake from maternal\\nplus fortiﬁed milk. For this reason it has been recommended that formula\\nmilks should provide at least 10mg selenium/day to complement the mater-\\nnal supply of selenium (13, 14).\\nClinical manifestations of deﬁciency arising from such situations are\\nuncommon and poorly deﬁned. They include muscular weakness and myalgia\\nwith, in several instances, the development of congestive heart failure. In at\\nleast one instance such pathologic signs have developed as a consequence of\\na generally inadequate diet providing selenium at less than 10mg/day.

Endemic in children aged 2–10 years and in women of childbear-\\ning age, this disease has a geographic distribution covering localities from\\nnorth-east to south-west China. Typical manifestations are fatigue after even\\nmild exercise, cardiac arrhythmia and palpitations, loss of appetite, cardiac\\ninsufﬁciency, cardiomegaly, and congestive heart failure. Pathological changes\\ninclude a multifocal myocardial necrosis and ﬁbrosis. The coronary arteries\\nare essentially unaffected. Ultrastructural studies show that membranous\\norganelles, such as mitochondria or sarcolemma, are affected earliest. The\\ndisease has a marked seasonal ﬂuctuation in incidence (3) and may appear after\\nonly 3 months exposure to conditions in localities known to be associated\\nwith a high risk of myocarditis (3, 8). Once the disease is established, sele-\\nnium is of little or no therapeutic value. However, prophylaxis consisting of\\noral administration of selenium 3 months before the periods of highest antic-\\nipated risk is highly effective.\\nAlthough geographic similarities in the distribution of Keshan disease and\\nthe selenium- and vitamin E-responsive white muscle disease in animals ﬁrst\\nprompted successful investigation of the relevance of a low selenium status,\\nevidence has grown steadily that the disease is multifactorial in origin.

For this reason the European Union Scientiﬁc Committee for\\nFood (89), the United Kingdom Committee on Medical Aspects of Food\\nPolicy (90), and the Netherlands Food and Nutrition Council (91) have sug-\\ngested that the component of selenium needed for human pregnancy is\\nobtained by an adaptive increase in the efﬁciency of absorption of dietary sele-\\nnium rather than by an increased dietary demand.\\nOthers, contesting this view, have attempted to predict the increase \\nof dietary selenium needed for pregnancy by factorial estimation of the \\nlikely quantity of selenium incorporated into the tissues of the fetus (60, 85).\\nSuch estimates have assumed that the total products of conception amount \\nto 4.6–6kg lean tissue with a protein content of approximately 18.5–20%. If,\\nas appears to be a reasonable assumption, the selenium content of this pro-\\ntein resembles that of a skeletal muscle, growth of these tissues could \\naccount for between 1.0 and 4.5mg/day of selenium depending on whether\\nthe analyses reﬂect consumption of diets from a low-selenium (but non-\\npathogenic) environment such as that found in New Zealand (52, 53) or from\\na region with relatively high selenium intakes, such as the United States \\n(see Table 10.3) (54, 55). Typically such estimates have assumed an 80%\\nabsorption and utilization of dietary selenium from which it would appear\\nreasonable to estimate that allowing for a variability of estimates (CV, 12.5%),'),\n",

The increase of maternal\\ndietary selenium needed to meet requirements for lactation has been estimated\\nfrom the estimated RNI for infants aged 0–6 months and 7–12 months. For\\nthe period 0–6 months it is estimated that the infant must receive 6mg/day of\\nselenium from human milk; assuming that the selenium of maternal milk is\\nused with an efﬁciency of 80% and given a SD of 12.5%, the increase of\\nmaternal dietary selenium required to produce this will be:\\nThe corresponding increase needed to meet the infant RNI of 10mg/day \\nfor infants aged 7–12 months will be 16mg/day.

If accumulated experience suggests that the CV of selenium intake\\nmay be 40% or more, and tabulated rather than analysed data are used to predict\\nthe dietary intake of selenium, the selenium allowances may have to be increased\\naccordingly (85).\\n10.7 Upper limits\\nA comprehensive account of the clinically signiﬁcant biochemical manifesta-\\ntions of chronic and acute intoxication from selenium arising from high con-\\ncentrations in food, drinking water, and the environment was published\\njointly by WHO, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the'),\n",

Common clinical features are\\nhair loss and structural changes in the keratin of hair and nails, the develop-\\nment of icteroid skin, and gastrointestinal disturbances (92, 93). An increased\\nincidence of nail dystrophy has been associated with consumption of high-\\nselenium foods supplying more than 900mg/day. These foods were grown in\\nselenium-rich (seleniferous) soil from speciﬁc areas in China (94). A positive\\nassociation between dental caries and urinary selenium output under similar\\ncircumstances has also been reported (95, 96).\\nLevander (33) stresses that the signs and symptoms of human overexpo-\\nsure to selenium are not well deﬁned. Furthermore, sensitive biochemical\\nmarkers of impending selenium intoxication have yet to be developed. In \\ntheir absence, it is suggested that the upper tolerable nutrient intake level \\n(UL) for selenium should be set, provisionally, at 400mg/day for adults. It is \\nnoteworthy that a maximum tolerable dietary concentration of 2mg/kg \\ndry diet has been proposed for all classes of domesticated livestock and \\nhas proved satisfactory in use (97). This suggests that the proposed UL of \\n400mg/day for human subjects provides a fully adequate margin of safety. \\nThe UL for children and for pregnant or lactating women has yet to be \\ndetermined.\\n10.8 Comparison with other estimates\\nCompared with WHO/FAO/IAEA (85), European Union (89), United\\nKingdom (90), and United States (86) recommendations, the present propos-\\nals represent a signiﬁcant decrease in the suggested need for selenium.

Under most circumstances, it will be unreasonable to expect that the\\noften marked inﬂuence of geographic variability on the supply of selenium\\nfrom cereals and meats can be taken into account. Changes in trade patterns\\nwith respect to the sources of cereals and meats are already having signiﬁcant\\ninﬂuences on the selenium nutrition of consumer communities (38, 72).

Magnesium\\n217\\n11.1 Tissue distribution and biological role of magnesium\\nThe human body contains about 760mg of magnesium at birth, approximately\\n5g at age 4–5 months, and 25g when adult (1–3). Of the body’s magnesium,\\n30–40% is found in muscles and soft tissues, 1% is found in extracellular ﬂuid,\\nand the remainder is in the skeleton, where it accounts for up to 1% of bone\\nash (4, 5).\\nSoft tissue magnesium functions as a cofactor of many enzymes involved in\\nenergy metabolism, protein synthesis, RNA and DNA synthesis, and mainte-\\nnance of the electrical potential of nervous tissues and cell membranes. Of par-\\nticular importance with respect to the pathological effects of magnesium\\ndepletion is the role of this element in regulating potassium ﬂuxes and its\\ninvolvement in the metabolism of calcium (6–8). Magnesium depletion\\ndepresses both cellular and extracellular potassium and exacerbates the effects\\nof low-potassium diets on cellular potassium content. Muscle potassium\\nbecomes depleted as magnesium deﬁciency develops, and tissue repletion of\\npotassium is virtually impossible unless magnesium status is restored to normal.\\nIn addition, low plasma calcium often develops as magnesium status declines.\\nIt is not clear whether this occurs because parathyroid hormone release is inhib-\\nited or, more probably, because of a reduced sensitivity of bone to parathyroid\\nhormone, thus restricting withdrawal of calcium from the skeletal matrix.'),\n",

Initially much of this magnesium is readily\\nexchangeable with serum and therefore represents a moderately accessible\\nmagnesium store which can be drawn on in times of deﬁciency. However, the\\nproportion of bone magnesium in this exchangeable form declines signiﬁ-\\ncantly with increasing age (9).\\nSigniﬁcant increases in bone mineral density of the femur have been asso-\\nciated positively with rises in erythrocyte magnesium when the diets of sub-\\njects with gluten-sensitive enteropathy were fortiﬁed with magnesium (10).\\nLittle is known of other roles for magnesium in skeletal tissues.\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n218\\n11.2 Populations at risk for, and consequences of,\\nmagnesium deficiency\\nPathological effects of primary nutritional deﬁciency of magnesium occur\\ninfrequently in infants (11) but are even less common in adults unless a rela-\\ntively low magnesium intake is accompanied by prolonged diarrhoea or exces-\\nsive urinary magnesium losses (12).

It has been suggested that a suboptimal magnesium\\nstatus may be a factor in the etiology of coronary heart disease and hyper-\\ntension but additional evidence is needed (16).\\n11.3 Dietary sources, absorption, and excretion of\\nmagnesium\\nDietary deﬁciency of magnesium of a severity sufﬁcient to provoke patho-\\nlogical changes is rare. Magnesium is widely distributed in plant and animal\\nfoods, and geochemical and other environmental variables rarely have a major\\ninﬂuence on its content in foods. Most green vegetables, legume seeds, beans,\\nand nuts are rich in magnesium, as are some shellﬁsh, spices, and soya ﬂour,\\nall of which usually contain more than 500mg/kg fresh weight. Although\\nmost unreﬁned cereal grains are reasonable sources, many highly-reﬁned\\nﬂours, tubers, fruits, fungi, and most oils and fats contribute little dietary\\nmagnesium (<100mg/kg fresh weight) (17–19). Corn ﬂour, cassava and sago\\nﬂour, and polished rice ﬂour have extremely low magnesium contents. Table\\n11.1 presents representative data for the dietary magnesium intakes of infants\\nand adults.\\nStable isotope studies with 25Mg and 26Mg indicate that between 50% and\\n90% of the labelled magnesium from maternal milk and infant formula can\\nbe absorbed by infants (11, 23).

Although this intake is far below the United States rec-\\nommended dietary allowance (RDA) for this age group (280mg/day), mag-\\nnesium balance was still positive and averaged 21mg/day.

There is no consistent evidence that modest\\nincreases in the intake of calcium (34–36), iron, or manganese (22) affect mag-\\nnesium balance.

The total body zinc content has\\nbeen estimated to be 30mmol (2g). Skeletal muscle accounts for approximately\\n60% of the total body content and bone mass, with a zinc concen-\\ntration of 1.5–3mmol/g (100–200mg/g), for approximately 30%. The concen-\\ntration of zinc in lean body mass is approximately 0.46mmol/g (30mg/g).\\nPlasma zinc has a rapid turnover rate and it represents only about 0.l% of total\\nbody zinc content. This level appears to be under close homeostatic control.\\nHigh concentrations of zinc are found in the choroid of the eye (4.2mmol/g\\nor 274mg/g) and in prostatic ﬂuids (4.6–7.7mmol/l or 300–500mg/l) (1).\\nZinc is an essential component of a large number (>300) of enzymes \\nparticipating in the synthesis and degradation of carbohydrates, lipids, \\nproteins, and nucleic acids as well as in the metabolism of other micronutri-\\nents. Zinc stabilizes the molecular structure of cellular components and mem-\\nbranes and in this way contributes to the maintenance of cell and organ\\nintegrity. Furthermore, zinc has an essential role in polynucleotide transcrip-\\ntion and thus in the process of genetic expression. Its involvement in such\\nfundamental activities probably accounts for the essentiality of zinc for all life\\nforms.\\nZinc plays a central role in the immune system, affecting a number of\\naspects of cellular and humoral immunity (2). Shankar and Prasad have\\nreviewed the role of zinc in immunity extensively (2).\\nThe clinical features of severe zinc deﬁciency in humans are growth retar-\\ndation, delayed sexual and bone maturation, skin lesions, diarrhoea, alopecia,\\nimpaired appetite, increased susceptibility to infections mediated via defects\\nin the immune system, and the appearance of behavioural changes (1). The\\neffects of marginal or mild zinc deﬁciency are less clear. A reduced growth'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='effects of marginal or mild zinc deﬁciency are less clear. A reduced growth\\nrate and impairments of immune defence are so far the only clearly demon-\\nstrated signs of mild zinc deﬁciency in humans. Other effects, such as\\nimpaired taste and wound healing, which have been claimed to result from a\\nlow zinc intake, are less consistently observed.\\n12.2 Zinc metabolism and homeostasis\\nZinc absorption is concentration dependent and occurs throughout the \\nsmall intestine. Under normal physiological conditions, transport processes\\nof uptake are not saturated. Zinc administered in aqueous solutions to fasting\\nsubjects is absorbed efﬁciently (60–70%), whereas absorption from solid diets\\nis less efﬁcient and varies depending on zinc content and diet composition (3).\\nThe major losses of zinc from the body are through the intestine and urine,\\nby desquamation of epithelial cells, and in sweat. Endogenous intestinal losses\\ncan vary from 7mmol/day (0.5mg/day) to more than 45mmol/day (3mg/day),\\ndepending on zinc intake—the higher the intake, the greater the losses (4).\\nUrinary and integumental losses are of the order of 7–10mmol/day (0.5–\\n0.7mg/day) each and depend less on normal variations in zinc intake (4). \\nStarvation and muscle catabolism increase zinc losses in urine. Strenuous \\nexercise and elevated ambient temperatures can lead to high losses through\\nperspiration.\\nThe body has no zinc stores in the conventional sense. In conditions of\\nbone resorption and tissue catabolism, zinc is released and may be reutilized\\nto some extent. Human experimental studies with low zinc diets containing\\n2.6–3.6mg/day (40–55mmol/day) have shown that circulating zinc levels and\\nactivities of zinc-containing enzymes can be maintained within a normal range\\nover several months (5, 6), a ﬁnding which highlights the efﬁciency of the zinc\\nhomeostasis mechanism.

However, the underlying mechanisms\\nare poorly understood.\\nSensitive indexes for assessing zinc status are unknown at present. Static\\nindexes, such as zinc concentration in plasma, blood cells, and hair, and\\nurinary zinc excretion are decreased in severe zinc deﬁciency. A number of\\nconditions that are unrelated to zinc status can affect all these indexes, espe-\\ncially zinc plasma levels. Food intake, stress situations such as fever, infection,\\nand pregnancy lower plasma zinc concentrations whereas, for example, long-\\nterm fasting increases it (11). However, on a population basis, reduced plasma\\nzinc concentrations seem to be a marker for zinc-responsive growth reduc-\\ntions (12, 13). Experimental zinc depletion studies suggest that changes in\\nimmune response occur before reductions in plasma zinc concentrations \\nare apparent (14). To date, it has not been possible to identify zinc-\\ndependent enzymes which could serve as early markers for zinc status.\\nA number of functional indexes of zinc status have been suggested, for\\nexample, wound healing, taste acuity, and visual adaptation to the dark (11).\\n12.

The size of the pool seems to be corre-\\nlated to habitual dietary intake and it is reduced in controlled depletion studies\\n(18). The zinc pool was also found to be correlated to endogenous intestinal\\nexcretion of zinc (19) and to total daily absorption of zinc. These data suggest\\nthat the size of the pool depends on recently absorbed zinc and that a larger\\nexchangeable pool results in larger endogenous excretion. Changes in endoge-\\nnous intestinal excretion of zinc seem to be more important than changes in\\nabsorptive efﬁciency for maintenance of zinc homeostasis (19).\\n12.3 Dietary sources and bioavailability of zinc\\nLean red meat, whole-grain cereals, pulses, and legumes provide the highest\\nconcentrations of zinc: concentrations in such foods are generally in the range\\nof 25–50mg/kg (380–760mmol/kg) raw weight. Processed cereals with low\\nextraction rates, polished rice, and chicken, pork or meat with high fat content\\nhave a moderate zinc content, typically between 10 and 25mg/kg (150–380\\nmmol/kg). Fish, roots and tubers, green leafy vegetables, and fruits are only\\nmodest sources of zinc, having concentrations <10mg/kg (<150mmol/kg)\\n(20). Saturated fats and oils, sugar, and alcohol have very low zinc contents.\\nThe utilization of zinc depends on the overall composition of the diet.\\nExperimental studies have identiﬁed a number of dietary factors as potential\\npromoters or antagonists of zinc absorption (21).

The risk of com-\\npetitive interactions with zinc seems to be mainly related to the consumption\\nof high doses of these other ions, in the form of supplements or in aqueous\\nsolutions. However, at levels present in food and at realistic fortiﬁcation\\nlevels, zinc absorption appears not to be affected, for example, by iron or\\ncopper (21).\\nIsotope studies with human subjects have identiﬁed two factors that,\\ntogether with the total zinc content of the diet, are major determinants of\\nabsorption and utilization of dietary zinc. The ﬁrst is the content of inositol\\nhexaphosphate (phytate) in the diet and the second is the level and source of\\ndietary protein. Phytates are present in whole-grain cereals and legumes \\nand in smaller amounts in other vegetables. They have a strong potential for\\nbinding divalent cations and their depressive effect on zinc absorption has\\nbeen demonstrated in humans (21). The molar ratio between phytates and zinc\\nin meals or diets is a useful indicator of the effect of phytates in depressing\\nzinc absorption. At molar ratios above the range of 6–10, zinc absorption\\nstarts to decline; at ratios above 15, absorption is typically less than 15% (20).\\nThe effect of phytate is, however, modiﬁed by the source and amount of\\ndietary proteins consumed. Animal proteins improve zinc absorption from a\\nphytate-containing diet (22). Zinc absorption from some legume-based diets\\n(e.g. white beans and lupin protein) is comparable with that from animal-\\nprotein-based diets despite a higher phytate content in the former (22, 23).\\nHigh dietary calcium potentiated the antagonistic effects of phytates on zinc\\nabsorption in experimental studies. The results from human studies are less\\nconsistent and any effects seem to depend on the source of calcium and the\\ncomposition of the diet (21, 23).\\nSeveral recently published absorption studies illustrate the effect of zinc'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='composition of the diet (21, 23).\\nSeveral recently published absorption studies illustrate the effect of zinc\\ncontent and diet composition on fractional zinc absorption (19, 24–26). The\\nresults from the total diet studies, where all main meals of a day’s intake were\\nextrinsically labelled, show a remarkable consistency in fractional absorption\\ndespite relatively large variations in meal composition and zinc content (see\\nTable 12.1). Thus, approximately twice as much zinc is absorbed from a non-\\nvegetarian or high-meat diet (25, 26) than from a diet based on rice and wheat\\nﬂour (19). Data are lacking on zinc absorption from typical diets of develop-\\ning countries, which usually have high phytate contents.\\nThe availability of zinc from the diet can be improved by reducing the\\nphytate content and including sources of animal protein. Lower extraction\\nrates of cereal grains will result in lower phytate content but at the same time\\nthe zinc content is reduced, so that the net effect on zinc supply is limited.\\nThe phytate content can be reduced by activating the phytase present in most\\nphytate-containing foods or through the addition of microbial or fungal phy-\\ntases. Phytases hydrolyse the phytate to lower inositol phosphates, resulting\\nin improved zinc absorption (27, 28). The activity of phytases in tropical\\ncereals such as maize and sorghum is lower than that in wheat and rye (29).\\nGermination of cereals and legumes increases phytase activity and addition of\\nsome germinated ﬂour to ungerminated maize or sorghum followed by\\n12.

Because zinc requirements are related to\\ntissue turnover rate and growth, it is reasonable to assume that variations in\\nphysiological zinc requirements are of the same magnitude as variations in\\nprotein requirements (37) and that the same ﬁgure (12.5%) for the interindi-\\nvidual coefﬁcient of variation (CV) could be adopted.

The physiology of iron has been exten-\\nsively reviewed (1–6).\\nMost of the iron in the body is present in the erythrocytes as haemoglo-\\nbin, a molecule composed of four units, each containing one haem group and\\none protein chain. The structure of haemoglobin allows it to be fully loaded\\nwith oxygen in the lungs and partially unloaded in the tissues (e.g. in the\\nmuscles). The iron-containing oxygen storage protein in the muscles, myo-\\nglobin, is similar in structure to haemoglobin but has only one haem unit and\\none globin chain. Several iron-containing enzymes, the cytochromes, also\\nhave one haem group and one globin protein chain. These enzymes act as \\nelectron carriers within the cell and their structures do not permit reversible\\nloading and unloading of oxygen. Their role in the oxidative metabolism is to\\ntransfer energy within the cell and speciﬁcally in the mitochondria. Other key\\nfunctions for the iron-containing enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450) include the\\nsynthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids; detoxiﬁcation of foreign sub-\\nstances in the liver; and signal controlling in some neurotransmitters, such as\\nthe dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. Iron is reversibly stored\\nwithin the liver as ferritin and haemosiderin whereas it is transported between\\ndifferent compartments in the body by the protein transferrin.\\n13.2 Iron metabolism and absorption\\n13.2.1 Basal iron losses\\nIron is not actively excreted from the body in urine or in the intestines. Iron\\nis only lost with cells from the skin and the interior surfaces of the body—\\nintestines, urinary tract, and airways. The total amount lost is estimated at \\n14mg/kg body weight/day (7).

However, new studies which took extensive\\nprecautions to avoid the interference of contamination of iron from the skin\\nduring the collection of total body sweat have shown that sweat iron losses\\nare negligible (9).\\n13.2.2 Requirements for growth\\nThe newborn term infant has an iron content of about 250–300mg (75mg/kg\\nbody weight). During the ﬁrst 2 months of life, haemoglobin concentration\\nfalls because of the improved oxygen situation in the newborn infant com-\\npared with the intrauterine fetus. This leads to a considerable redistribution\\nof iron from catabolized erythrocytes to iron stores. This iron will cover the\\nneeds of the term infant during the ﬁrst 4–6 months of life and is why iron\\nrequirements during this period can be provided by human milk, which con-\\ntains very little iron. Because of the marked supply of iron to the fetus during\\nthe last trimester of pregnancy, the iron situation is much less favourable in\\nthe premature and low-birth-weight infant than in the healthy term infant.\\nAn extra supply of iron is therefore needed in these infants during the ﬁrst 6\\nmonths of life.\\nIn the term infant, iron requirements rise markedly after age 4–6 months\\nand amount to about 0.7–0.9mg/day during the remaining part of the ﬁrst\\nyear. These requirements are very high, especially in relation to body size and\\nenergy intake (Table 13.1) (10).\\nIn the ﬁrst year of life, the term infant almost doubles its total iron stores\\nand triples its body weight. The increase in body iron during this period\\noccurs mainly during the latter 6 months. Between 1 and 6 years of age, the\\nbody iron content is again doubled.

The pool concept also implies that the absorption of iron from the\\nnon-haem iron pool is a function of all the ligands present in the mixture of\\nfoods included in a meal.

IRON\\n255\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n256\\nMore recently, however, new techniques, based on radioiron tracers, have\\nbeen developed to measure iron absorption from the whole diet. In the ﬁrst\\nstudies of this type to be conducted, all non-haem iron in all meals over periods\\nof 5–10 days was homogeneously labelled to the same speciﬁc activity with an\\nextrinsic inorganic radioiron tracer (43, 60). Haem iron absorption was then\\nestimated. In a further study, haem and non-haem iron were separately labelled\\nwith two radioiron tracers as biosynthetically labelled haemoglobin and as an\\ninorganic iron salt (22). These studies showed that new information could be\\nobtained, for example, about the average bioavailability of dietary iron in dif-\\nferent types of diets, the overall effects of certain factors (e.g. calcium) on iron\\nnutrition, and the regulation of iron absorption in relation to iron status. Iron\\nabsorption from the whole diet has been extrapolated from the sum of the\\nabsorption of iron from the single meals included in the diet. However, it has\\nbeen suggested that the iron absorption of single meals may exaggerate the\\nabsorption of iron from the whole diet (61, 62), as there is a large variation of\\nabsorption between meals. Despite this, studies where all meals in a diet are\\nlabelled to the same speciﬁc activity (the same amount of radioactivity in each'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='labelled to the same speciﬁc activity (the same amount of radioactivity in each\\nmeal per unit iron) show that the sum of iron absorption from a great number\\nof single meals agrees with the total absorption from the diet.

The use of the concept of bioavailable nutrient density is a\\nfeasible way to compare bioavailability of iron in different meals, construct\\nmenus, and calculate recommended intakes of iron (64).\\nIntake of energy and essential nutrients such as iron was probably consid-\\nerably higher for early humans than it is today (65–67). The fact that low iron\\nintake is associated with a low-energy lifestyle implies that the interaction\\nbetween different factors inﬂuencing iron absorption, will be more critical.\\nFor example, the interaction between calcium and iron absorption probably\\nhad no importance in the nutrition of early humans, who had a diet with\\nample amounts of both iron and calcium.\\n13.2.9 Iron balance and regulation of iron absorption\\nThe body has three unique mechanisms for maintaining iron balance. The ﬁrst\\nis the continuous reutilization of iron from catabolized erythrocytes in the\\nbody. When an erythrocyte dies after about 120 days, it is usually degraded\\nby the macrophages of the reticular endothelium. The iron is released and\\ndelivered to transferrin in the plasma, which brings the iron back to red blood\\ncell precursors in the bone marrow or to other cells in different tissues.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='cell precursors in the bone marrow or to other cells in different tissues.\\nUptake and distribution of iron in the body is regulated by the synthesis of\\ntransferrin receptors on the cell surface. This system for internal iron trans-\\nport not only controls the rate of ﬂow of iron to different tissues according\\nto their needs, but also effectively prevents the appearance of free iron and\\nthe formation of free radicals in the circulation.\\nThe second mechanism involves access to the speciﬁc storage protein, fer-\\nritin. This protein stores iron in periods of relatively low need and releases it\\nto meet excessive iron demands. This iron reservoir is especially important in\\nthe third trimester of pregnancy.\\nThe third mechanism involves the regulation of absorption of iron from\\nthe intestines; decreasing body iron stores trigger increased iron absorption\\nand increasing iron stores trigger decreased iron absorption. Iron absorption\\ndecreases until equilibrium is established between absorption and require-\\nment. For a given diet this regulation of iron absorption, however, can only\\nbalance losses up to a certain critical point beyond which iron deﬁciency will\\ndevelop (68). About half of the basal iron losses are from blood and occur\\nprimarily in the gastrointestinal tract. Both these losses and the menstrual iron\\nlosses are inﬂuenced by the haemoglobin level; during the development of an\\niron deﬁciency, menstrual and basal iron losses will successively decrease\\nwhen the haemoglobin level decreases. In a state of more severe iron deﬁ-\\nciency, skin iron losses may also decrease. Iron balance (absorption equals\\nlosses) may be present not only in normal subjects but also during iron deﬁ-\\nciency and iron overload.\\nThe three main factors that affect iron balance are absorption (intake and\\nbioavailability of iron), losses, and stored amount.

The weaning\\nperiod in infants is especially critical because of the very high iron require-\\nment needed in relation to energy requirement (see section 13.2.2). Thanks to\\nbetter information about iron deﬁciency and the addition of fortiﬁed cereals\\nto the diets of infants and children, the iron situation has markedly improved\\nin these groups in most developed countries, such that the groups currently\\nconsidered to be most at risk are menstruating and pregnant women, and ado-\\nlescents of both sexes. In developing countries, however, the iron situation is\\nstill very critical in many groups—especially in infants in the weaning period.\\nDuring this period, iron nutrition is of great importance for the adequate\\ndevelopment of the brain and other tissues such as muscles, which are differ-\\nentiated early in life.\\nIron deﬁciency and iron deﬁciency anaemia are often incorrectly used as\\nsynonyms. A deﬁnition of these terms may clarify some of the confusion\\nabout different prevalence ﬁgures given in the literature (70).

The confusion arises due to the very wide\\ndistribution of the haemoglobin concentration in healthy, fully iron-replete\\nsubjects (in women, 120–160g/l; in men, 140–180g/l) (71). During the devel-\\nopment of a negative iron balance in subjects with no mobilizable iron from\\niron stores (i.e. no visible iron in technically perfect bone marrow smears or\\na serum ferritin concentration <15mg/l), there will be an immediate impair-\\nment in the production of haemoglobin with a resulting decrease in haemo-\\nglobin and different erythrocyte indexes (e.g. mean corpuscular haemoglobin\\nand mean corpuscular volume). In turn, this will lead to an overlap in the dis-\\ntributions of haemoglobin in iron-deﬁcient and iron-replete women (Figure\\n13.4). The extent of overlap depends on the prevalence and severity of iron\\ndeﬁciency. In populations with more severe iron deﬁciency, for example, the\\noverlap is much less marked.\\nIn women, anaemia is deﬁned as a haemoglobin level <120g/l. For a\\nwoman who has her normal homeostatic value set at 150g/l, her haemoglo-\\nbin level must decrease by 26% to 119g/l before she is considered to be\\nanaemic, whereas for a woman who has her normal haemoglobin set at \\n121g/l, her haemoglobin level must only decrease by 1.5% to 119g/l. Iron\\ndeﬁciency anaemia is a rather imprecise concept for evaluating the single\\nsubject and has no immediate physiological meaning. By deﬁnition, this\\nimplies that the prevalence of iron deﬁciency anaemia is less frequent than\\niron deﬁciency and that the presence of anaemia in a subject is a statistical\\nrather than a functional concept.

Liver cells will get less iron, more trans-\\nferrin will be synthesized, and the concentration of transferrin in plasma will\\nthen suddenly increase. Cells with a high turnover rate are the ﬁrst ones to\\nbe affected (e.g. intestinal mucosal cells with a short lifespan). The iron–trans-\\nferrin complex binds to transferrin receptors on certain cell surfaces and is\\nthen taken up by invagination of the whole complex on the cell wall. The\\nuptake of iron seems to be related both to transferrin saturation and the\\nnumber of transferrin receptors on the cell surface (73, 74). There is a marked\\ndiurnal variation in the saturation of transferrin because the turnover rate of\\niron in plasma is very high. This fact makes it difﬁcult to evaluate the iron\\nstatus from single determinations of transferrin saturation.\\n13.3.2 Indicators of iron deficiency\\nThe absence of iron stores (iron deﬁciency) can be diagnosed by showing that\\nthere is no stainable iron in the reticuloendothelial cells in bone marrow\\nsmears or, more easily, by a low concentration of ferritin in serum (<15mg/l).\\nEven if an absence of iron stores per se may not necessarily be associated with\\nany immediate adverse effects, it is a reliable and good indirect indicator of\\niron-deﬁcient erythropoiesis and of an increased risk of a compromised\\nsupply of iron to different tissues.\\nEven before iron stores are completely exhausted, the supply of iron to the\\nerythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow is compromised, leading to iron-\\ndeﬁcient erythropoiesis (70).

All these\\nindicators, however, show a marked overlap between normal and iron-\\ndeﬁcient subjects, which makes it impossible to identify the single subject\\nwith mild iron deﬁciency by looking at any single one of these indicators.\\nTherefore, these tests are generally used in combination (e.g. for interpreting\\nresults from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\\nin the United States [75, 76]). By increasing the number of tests used, the diag-\\nnostic speciﬁcity then increases but the sensitivity decreases, and thus the true\\nprevalence of iron deﬁciency is markedly underestimated if multiple diag-\\nnostic criteria are used.

A recent estimate based on WHO criteria indicated that around\\n600–700 million people worldwide have marked iron deﬁciency anaemia (81),\\nand the bulk of these people live in developing countries. In developed coun-\\ntries, the prevalence of iron deﬁciency anaemia is much lower and usually\\nvaries between 2% and 8%. However, the prevalence of iron deﬁciency,\\nincluding both anaemic and non-anaemic subjects (see deﬁnitions above), is\\nmuch higher. In developed countries, for example, an absence of iron stores\\nor subnormal serum ferritin values is found in about 20–30% of women of\\nfertile age. In adolescent girls, the prevalence is even higher.\\nIt is difﬁcult to determine the prevalence of iron deﬁciency more exactly\\nbecause representative populations for clinical investigation are hard to obtain.\\nLaboratory methods and techniques for blood sampling need careful stan-\\ndardization. One often neglected source of error (e.g. when samples from \\ndifferent regions, or samples taken at different times, are compared) comes\\nfrom the use of reagent kits for determining serum ferritin that are not \\nadequately calibrated to international WHO standards.

The physical working\\ncapacity of rats is signiﬁcantly reduced in states of iron deﬁciency, especially\\nduring endurance activities (82, 83). This negative effect seems to be less\\nrelated to the degree of anaemia than to impaired oxidative metabolism in the\\nmuscles with an increased formation of lactic acid. Thus, the effect witnessed\\nseems to be due to a lack of iron-containing enzymes which are rate limiting\\nfor oxidative metabolism (84). Further to this, several groups have observed\\na reduction in physical working capacity in human populations with long-\\nstanding iron deﬁciency, and demonstrated an improvement in working\\ncapacity in these populations after iron administration (84).\\nThe relationship between iron deﬁciency and brain function and develop-\\nment is very important to consider when choosing a strategy to combat \\niron deﬁciency (85–88).

In animal studies, the cell-mediated immunologic response\\nby the action of T-lymphocytes is impaired as a result of a reduced formation\\nof these cells. This in turn is due to a reduced DNA synthesis dependent on\\nthe function of ribonucleotide reductase, which requires a continuous supply\\nof iron for its function. In addition, the phagocytosis and killing of bacteria\\nby the neutrophil leukocytes is an important component of the defence mech-\\nanism against infections.

Table 13.3 shows examples of diets with different iron\\nbioavailability. Table 13.4 shows the bioavailability of iron for two levels of\\niron intake in a 55-kg woman with no iron stores.\\nIron absorption data are also available from several population groups in\\nAfrica (100), South America (101), India (102), and south-east (103–107) Asia.\\nThe bioavailability of different Indian diets, after an adjustment to a reference\\ndose absorption of 56.5%, was 1.7–1.8% for millet-based diets, 3.5–4.0% for\\n13.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Asia, iron absorption data has been reported from Burma and Thailand. In\\nBurma, iron absorption from a basal rice-based meal was 1.7%; when the meal\\ncontained 15g of ﬁsh the bioavailability of iron was 5.5%, and with 40g of\\nﬁsh, it was 10.1% (103). In Thailand, iron absorption from a basal rice-based\\nmeal was 1.9%; adding 100g of fresh fruit increased absorption to 4.8% and\\nadding 80g of lean meat increased non-haem iron absorption to 5.4% (104,\\n105). In three other studies where basal meals included servings of vegetables\\nrich in ascorbic acid, the absorption ﬁgures were 5.9%, 10.0%, and 10.8%,\\nrespectively (106). In a further study in Thailand, 60g of ﬁsh were added to\\nthe same basal meal, which increased absorption to 21.6% (106). Another such\\nstudy in central Thailand examined the reproducibility of dietary iron absorp-\\ntion measurements under optimal ﬁeld conditions for 20 farmers and labour-\\ners (16 men, 4 women). The subjects had a free choice of foods (i.e. rice,\\nvegetables, soup, a curry, and a ﬁsh dish). All foods consumed were weighed\\nand the rice was labelled with an extrinsic radioiron tracer. The mean absorp-\\ntion of iron was 20.3% (adjusted to reference dose absorption of 56.5%) (107).\\nIt is obvious that absorbed iron requirements need to be adjusted to dif-\\nferent types of diets, especially in vulnerable groups. In setting recommended\\nintakes in the 1980s FAO and WHO proposed, for didactic reasons, the use\\nof three bioavailability levels, 5%, 10%, and 15% (8). In light of more recent\\nstudies discussed herein, for developing countries, it may be more realistic to\\nuse the ﬁgures of 5% and 10%. In populations consuming more Western-type\\ndiets, two levels would be appropriate—12% and 15%—depending mainly\\non meat intake.\\nThe amount of dietary iron absorbed is mainly determined by the amount\\nof body stores of iron and by the properties of the diet (iron content and\\nbioavailability).

For example, in a 55-kg woman with average iron\\nlosses who consumes a diet with an iron bioavailability of 15%, the mean iron\\nstores would be about 120mg. Furthermore, approximately 10–15% of\\nwomen consuming this diet would have no iron stores. In a 55-kg woman\\nwho consumes a diet with an iron bioavailability of 12%, iron stores would\\nbe approximately 75mg and about 25–30% of women consuming this diet\\nwould have no iron stores. When the bioavailability of iron decreases to 10%,\\nmean iron stores are reduced to about 25mg, and about 40–50% of women\\nconsuming this diet would have no iron stores. Women consuming diets with\\nan iron bioavailability of 5% have no iron stores and they are iron deﬁcient.\\n13.7 Recommendations for iron intakes\\nThe recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) for varying dietary iron bioavail-\\nabilities are shown in Table 13.5. The RNIs are based on the 95th percentile\\nof the absorbed iron requirements (Table 13.1). No ﬁgures are given for\\ndietary iron requirements in pregnant women because the iron balance in\\npregnancy depends not only on the properties of the diet but also and espe-\\ncially on the amounts of stored iron.\\n13.

Vitamin B12\\n279\\n14.1 Role of vitamin B12 in human metabolic processes\\nAlthough the nutritional literature still uses the term vitamin B12, a more \\nspeciﬁc name for vitamin B12 is cobalamin. Vitamin B12 is the largest of the B\\ncomplex vitamins, with a relative molecular mass of over 1000. It consists of\\na corrin ring made up of four pyrroles with cobalt at the centre of the ring\\n(1, 2).\\nThere are several vitamin B12-dependent enzymes in bacteria and algae, but\\nno species of plants have the enzymes necessary for vitamin B12 synthesis. This\\nfact has signiﬁcant implications for the dietary sources and availability of\\nvitamin B12. In mammalian cells, there are only two vitamin B12-dependent\\nenzymes (3). One of these enzymes, methionine synthase, uses the chemical\\nform of the vitamin which has a methyl group attached to the cobalt \\nand is called methylcobalamin (see Chapter 15, Figure 15.2). The other\\nenzyme, methylmalonyl coenzyme (CoA) mutase, uses a form of vitamin B12'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='enzyme, methylmalonyl coenzyme (CoA) mutase, uses a form of vitamin B12\\nthat has a 5¢-adeoxyadenosyl moiety attached to the cobalt and is called 5¢-\\ndeoxyadenosylcobalamin, or coenzyme B12. In nature, there are two other\\nforms of vitamin B12: hydroxycobalamin and aquacobalamin, where hydroxyl\\nand water groups, respectively, are attached to the cobalt. The synthetic form\\nof vitamin B12 found in supplements and fortiﬁed foods is cyanocobalamin,\\nwhich has cyanide attached to the cobalt. These three forms of vitamin B12 are \\nenzymatically activated to the methyl- or deoxyadenosylcobalamins in all\\nmammalian cells.\\n14.2 Dietary sources and availability\\nMost microorganisms, including bacteria and algae, synthesize vitamin B12,\\nand they constitute the only source of the vitamin (4). The vitamin B12 syn-\\nthesized in microorganisms enters the human food chain through incorpora-\\ntion into food of animal origin. In many animals, gastrointestinal fermentation\\nsupports the growth of these vitamin B12 synthesizing microorganisms, and\\nsubsequently the vitamin is absorbed and incorporated into the animal tissues.\\nThis is particularly true for the liver, where vitamin B12 is stored in large con-\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n280\\ncentrations. Products from herbivorous animals, such as milk, meat, and eggs,\\nthus constitute important dietary sources of the vitamin, unless the animal is\\nsubsisting in one of the many regions known to be geochemically deﬁcient in\\ncobalt (5). Milk from cows and humans contains binders with very high afﬁn-\\nity for vitamin B12, though whether they hinder or promote intestinal absorp-\\ntion is not entirely clear. Omnivores and carnivores, including humans, derive\\ndietary vitamin B12 almost exclusively from animal tissues or products (i.e.\\nmilk, butter, cheese, eggs, meat, poultry). It appears that the vitamin B12\\nrequired by humans is not derived from microﬂora in any appreciable quan-'),\n",

Vitamin B12 in \\nfood is bound to proteins and is only released by the action of a high \\nconcentration of hydrochloric acid present in the stomach. This process\\nresults in the free form of the vitamin, which is immediately bound to a\\nmixture of glycoproteins secreted by the stomach and salivary glands. These\\nglycoproteins, called R-binders (or haptocorrins), protect vitamin B12 from\\nchemical denaturation in the stomach. The stomach’s parietal cells, which\\nsecrete hydrochloric acid, also secrete a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor.\\nIntrinsic factor binds vitamin B12 and ultimately enables its active absorption.\\nAlthough the formation of the vitamin B12–intrinsic factor complex was ini-\\ntially thought to happen in the stomach, it is now clear that this is not the\\ncase. At an acidic pH, the afﬁnity of the intrinsic factor for vitamin B12 is low\\nwhereas its afﬁnity for the R-binders is high. When the contents of the\\nstomach enter the duodenum, the R-binders become partly digested by the\\npancreatic proteases, which in turn causes them to release their vitamin B12.\\nBecause the pH in the duodenum is more neutral than that in the stomach,\\nthe intrinsic factor has a high binding afﬁnity to vitamin B12, and it \\nquickly binds the vitamin as it is released from the R-binders. The vitamin\\nB12–intrinsic factor complex then proceeds to the lower end of the small \\nintestine, where it is absorbed by phagocytosis by speciﬁc ileal receptors \\n(1, 2).\\n14.4 Populations at risk for, and consequences of, vitamin\\nB12 deficiency\\n14.4.1 Vegetarians\\nBecause plants do not synthesize vitamin B12, individuals who consume diets\\ncompletely free of animal products (vegan diets) are at risk of vitamin B12 deﬁ-'),\n",

This is not true of lacto-ovo vegetarians, who consume the vitamin in\\neggs, milk, and other dairy products.\\n14.4.2 Pernicious anaemia\\nMalabsorption of vitamin B12 can occur at several points during digestion (1,\\n4). By far the most important condition resulting in vitamin B12 malabsorp-\\ntion is the autoimmune disease called pernicious anaemia (PA). In most cases\\nof PA, antibodies are produced against the parietal cells causing them to\\natrophy, and lose their ability to produce intrinsic factor and secrete\\nhydrochloric acid. In some forms of PA, the parietal cells remain intact but\\nautoantibodies are produced against the intrinsic factor itself and attach to it,\\nthus preventing it from binding vitamin B12. In another less common form of\\nPA, the antibodies allow vitamin B12 to bind to the intrinsic factor but prevent\\nthe absorption of the intrinsic factor–vitamin B12 complex by the ileal recep-\\ntors. As is the case with most autoimmune diseases, the incidence of PA\\nincreases markedly with age. In most ethnic groups, it is virtually unknown\\nto occur before the age of 50, with a progressive rise in incidence thereafter\\n(4). However, African American populations are known to have an earlier age\\nof presentation (4). In addition to causing malabsorption of dietary vitamin\\nB12, PA also results in an inability to reabsorb the vitamin B12 which is secreted\\nin the bile. Biliary secretion of vitamin B12 is estimated to be between 0.3 and\\n0.5mg/day. Interruption of this so-called enterohepatic circulation of vitamin\\nB12 causes the body to go into a signiﬁcant negative balance for the vitamin.\\nAlthough the body typically has sufﬁcient vitamin B12 stores to last 3–5 years,\\nonce PA has been established, the lack of absorption of new vitamin B12 is\\ncompounded by the loss of the vitamin because of negative balance. When\\nthe stores have been depleted, the ﬁnal stages of deﬁciency are often quite'),\n",

More recently, it has been suggested\\nthat a far more common problem is that of hypochlorhydria associated with\\natrophic gastritis, where there is a progressive reduction with age of the ability\\nof the parietal cells to secrete hydrochloric acid (7). It is claimed that perhaps\\nup to one quarter of elderly subjects could have various degrees of\\nhypochlorhydria as a result of atrophic gastritis. It has also been suggested\\nthat bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and intestine in individuals suffer-\\ning from atrophic gastritis may also reduce vitamin B12 absorption. The\\n14. VITAMIN B12\\n281\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n282\\nabsence of acid in the stomach is postulated to prevent the release of protein-\\nbound vitamin B12 contained in food but not to interfere with the absorption\\nof the free vitamin B12 found in fortiﬁed foods or supplements. Atrophic gas-\\ntritis does not prevent the reabsorption of biliary vitamin B12 and therefore\\ndoes not result in the negative balance seen in individuals with PA. Nonethe-\\nless, it is agreed that with time, a reduction in the amount of vitamin B12\\nabsorbed from the diet will eventually deplete vitamin B12 stores, resulting in\\novert deﬁciency.\\nWhen considering recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) for vitamin B12\\nfor the elderly, it is important to take into account the absorption of vitamin\\nB12 from sources such as fortiﬁed foods or supplements as compared with\\ndietary vitamin B12.

It is probable that this is also true of vitamin B12 in forti-\\nﬁed foods, although this has not been speciﬁcally examined. However,\\nabsorption of food-bound vitamin B12 has been reported to vary from 9% to\\n60% depending on the study and the source of the vitamin, which is perhaps\\nrelated to its incomplete release from food (8). This has led many to estimate\\nabsorption as being up to 50% to correct for the bioavailability of vitamin B12\\nfrom food.\\n14.5 Vitamin B12 interaction with folate or folic acid\\nOne of the vitamin B12-dependent enzymes, methionine synthase, functions\\nin one of the two folate cycles, namely, the methylation cycle (see Chapter\\n15). This cycle is necessary to maintain availability of the methyl donor, \\nS-adenosylmethionine. Interruption of the cycle reduces the level of S-adeno-\\nsylmethionine. This occurs in PA and other causes of vitamin B12 deﬁciency,\\nproducing as a result demyelination of the peripheral nerves and the spinal\\ncolumn, giving rise to the clinical condition called subacute combined degen-\\neration (1, 2). This neuropathy is one of the main presenting conditions in\\nPA. The other principal presenting condition in PA is a megaloblastic anaemia\\nmorphologically identical to that seen in folate deﬁciency. Disruption of the\\nmethylation cycle also causes a lack of DNA biosynthesis and anaemia.\\nThe methyl trap hypothesis is based on the fact that once the cofactor 5,10-\\nmethylenetetrahydrofolate is reduced by its reductase to form 5-methylte-\\ntrahydrofolate, the reverse reaction cannot occur. This suggests that the only\\nway for the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to be recycled to tetrahydrofolate, and\\nthus to participate in DNA biosynthesis and cell division, is through the\\nvitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase. When the activity of this'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase. When the activity of this\\nsynthase is compromised, as it would be in PA, the cellular folate will become\\nprogressively trapped as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (see Chapter 15, Figure\\n15.2). This will result in a cellular pseudo-folate deﬁciency where, despite\\nadequate amounts of folate, anaemia will develop, which is identical to that\\nseen in true folate deﬁciency. Clinical symptoms of PA, therefore, include\\nneuropathy, anaemia, or both. Treatment with vitamin B12, if given intramus-\\ncularly, will reactivate methionine synthase, allowing myelination to restart.\\nThe trapped folate will be released and DNA synthesis and generation of red\\ncells will cure the anaemia. Treatment with high concentrations of folic acid\\nwill treat the anaemia but not the neuropathy of PA. It should be stressed that\\nthe so-called “masking” of the anaemia of PA is generally agreed not to occur\\nat concentrations of folate found in food or at intakes of the synthetic form\\nof folic acid at usual RNI levels of 200 or 400mg/day (1). However, there is\\nsome evidence that amounts less than 400mg may cause a haematologic\\nresponse and thus potentially treat the anaemia (9).

It is clear that in vitamin\\nB12 deﬁciency the activity of the mutase is compromised, resulting in high\\nplasma or urine concentrations of methylmalonic acid (MMA), a degradation\\nproduct of methylmalonyl CoA mutase.

Recently, Lindenbaum et al. (10)\\nchallenged this assumption, by suggesting that a proportion of people with\\nnormal serum and plasma vitamin B12 levels are in fact vitamin B12 deﬁcient.\\nThey also suggested that elevation of plasma homocysteine and plasma MMA\\nare more sensitive indicators of vitamin B12 status. Although plasma homo-\\ncysteine can also be elevated because of folate or vitamin B6 deﬁciency, \\nelevation of MMA apparently always occurs with poor vitamin B12 status.\\nHowever, there may be other reasons why MMA is elevated, such as renal\\n14. VITAMIN B12\\n283\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION\\n284\\ninsufﬁciency, so the elevation of MMA, in itself, is not diagnostic. Thus, low\\nserum or plasma levels of vitamin B12 should be the ﬁrst indication of poor\\nstatus and this could be conﬁrmed by an elevated MMA if this assay was \\navailable.\\n14.7 Recommendations for vitamin B12 intakes\\nThe Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)\\nInstitute of Medicine (8) has recently conducted an exhaustive review of the\\nevidence regarding vitamin B12 intake, status, and health implications for all\\nage groups, including the periods of pregnancy and lactation.

There\\nis a wide difference in the vitamin B12 values reported in human milk because\\nof differences in methodology. The previous FAO/WHO Expert Consulta-\\ntion (11) based their recommendations on milk vitamin B12 values of normal\\nwomen of about 0.4mg/l. For an average milk production of 0.75l/day, the\\nvitamin B12 intake by infants would be 0.3mg/day (12).

Although daily intakes ranging from 0.02 to 0.05mg/day have been\\nfound to prevent deﬁciency (18, 19), these intakes are totally inadequate for\\nlong-term health. Thus, based on the assumption that human milk contains\\nenough vitamin B12 for optimum health, an EAR between 0.3 and 0.6mg/day\\nseems reasonable giving an RNI of between 0.4 and 0.7mg/day. It would seem\\nappropriate to use the lower RNI ﬁgure of 0.4mg/day for infants aged 0–6\\nmonths and the higher RNI ﬁgure of 0.7mg/day for infants aged 7–12 months\\n(Table 14.1).\\n14.7.2 Children\\nThe Food and Nutrition Board of the NAS Institute of Medicine (8) sug-\\ngested the same intakes for adolescents as those for adults (see section 14.7.3)\\nwith progressive reduction of intake for younger groups.\\n14.7.3 Adults\\nSeveral lines of evidence point to an adult average requirement of about \\n2.0mg/day. The amount of intramuscular vitamin B12 needed to maintain \\nremission in people with PA suggests a requirement of about 1.5mg/day (10),\\nbut they would also be losing 0.3–0.5mg/day through interruption of their\\nenterohepatic circulation. This might suggest a requirement of 0.7–1.0mg/day\\nfor those without PA. Because vitamin B12 is not completely absorbed from\\nfood, an adjustment of 50% has to be added, giving a range of 1.4–2.0mg/day\\n(4). Therapeutic response to dietary vitamin B12 suggests a minimum \\nrequirement of something less than 1.0mg/day (8), which again suggests a\\nrequirement of 2.0mg/day, allowing for the conservative correction that \\nonly half of dietary vitamin B12 is absorbed (8). Diets containing 1.8mg/day\\nseemed to maintain adequate status but intakes lower than this resulted in\\nsubjects showing some signs of deﬁciency (8). Furthermore, dietary intakes\\n14.

It has \\nbeen reported that children born to vegetarians or other women with a \\nlow vitamin B12 intake subsequently develop signs of clinical vitamin B12\\ndeﬁciency such as neuropathy (13). Therefore, in order to derive an EAR \\nfor pregnant women, 0.2mg/day of vitamin B12 was added to the EAR for\\nadults, to give an EAR of 2.2mg/day and a RNI of 2.6mg/day during \\npregnancy.\\n14.7.5 Lactating women\\nIt is estimated that 0.4mg/day of vitamin B12 is found in the human milk of\\nwomen with adequate vitamin B12 status (8). Therefore, an extra 0.4mg/day of\\nvitamin B12 is needed during lactation in addition to the normal adult require-\\nment of 2.0mg/day, giving a total EAR of 2.4mg/day and a RNI of 2.8mg/day\\nduring lactation.\\n14.8 Upper limits\\nThe absorption of vitamin B12 mediated by the glycoprotein, intrinsic \\nfactor, is limited to 1.5–2.0mg per meal because of the limited capacity of the\\nreceptors. In addition, between 1% and 3% of any particular oral adminis-\\ntration of vitamin B12 is absorbed by passive diffusion. Thus, if 1000mg\\nvitamin B12 (sometimes used to treat those with PA) is taken orally, the\\namount absorbed would be 2.0mg by active absorption plus up to about 30\\nmg by passive diffusion.

They are easily split between the C-9 and N-10 bond to yield a\\nsubstituted pteridine and p-aminobenzoylglutamate, which have no biologic\\nactivity (2). Substituting a carbon group at N-5 or N-10 decreases the ten-\\ndency of the molecule to split; however, the substituted forms are also sus-\\nceptible to oxidative chemical rearrangements and, consequently, loss of\\nactivity (2). The folates found in food consist of a mixture of reduced folate\\npolyglutamates.\\nThe chemical lability of all naturally-occurring folates results in a signiﬁ-\\ncant loss of biochemical activity during harvesting, storage, processing, and\\npreparation.

This process is apparently\\nnot complete (4), thereby reducing the bioavailability of natural folates by \\nas much as 25–50%. In contrast, synthetic folic acid appears to be highly\\nbioavailable—85% or greater (4, 5). The low bioavailability and, more impor-\\ntantly, the poor chemical stability of the natural folates have a profound inﬂu-\\nence on the development of nutrient recommendations. This is particularly\\ntrue if some of the dietary intake is as the more stable and bioavailable syn-\\nthetic form, folic acid. Fortiﬁcation of foods such as breakfast cereals and\\nﬂour can add signiﬁcant amounts of folic acid to the diet.\\nFunctional folates have one-carbon groups derived from several metabolic\\nprecursors (e.g. serine, N-formino-l-glutamate, and folate). With 10-formyl-\\ntetrahydrofolate, the formyl group is incorporated sequentially into C-2 and\\nC-8 of the purine ring during its biosynthesis. Similarly, the conversion of\\ndeoxyuridylate (a precursor to RNA) into thymidylate (a precursor to DNA)\\nis catalysed by thymidylate synthase, which requires 5,10-methylenetetrahy-\\ndrofolate. Thus, folate in its reduced and polyglutamylated forms is essential\\nfor the DNA biosynthesis cycle shown in Figure 15.2.\\nAlternatively, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate can be channelled to the\\nmethylation cycle (Figure 15.2) (1). This cycle has two functions. It ensures\\nthat the cell always has an adequate supply of S-adenosylmethionine, an acti-\\nvated form of methionine which acts as a methyl donor to a wide range of\\nmethyltransferases. The methyltransferases methylate a wide range of sub-\\nstrates including lipids, hormones, DNA, and proteins. One particularly\\nimportant methylation is that of myelin basic protein, which acts as insula-\\ntion for nerve cells.

Other important methyltrans-\\nferase enzymes down-regulate DNA and suppress cell division (1).\\nIn the liver, the methylation cycle also serves to degrade methionine.\\nMethionine is an essential amino acid in humans and is present in the diet of\\npeople in developed countries at about 60% over that required for protein\\nsynthesis and other uses. The excess methionine is degraded via the methyla-\\ntion cycle to homocysteine, which can either be catabolized to sulfate and\\npyruvate (with the latter being used for energy) or remethylated to methion-\\nine. All cells including the liver metabolize methionine to homocysteine as\\npart of the methylation cycle. This cycle results in converting methionine to\\nS-adenosylmethionine, which is used as a methyl donor for the numerous\\nmethyltransferences that exist in all cells. This cycle effectively consumes\\nmethyl (-CH3) groups and these must be replenished if the cycle is to main-\\ntain an adequate concentration of S-adenosylmethionine, and thus the methy-\\nlation reactions necessary for cell metabolism and survival. These methyl\\ngroups are added to the cycle as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which the enzyme\\nmethionine synthase uses to remethylate homocysteine back to methionine\\nand thus to S-adenosylmethionine (Figure 15.2).\\nThe DNA and methylation cycles both regenerate tetrahydrofolate.\\nHowever, there is a considerable amount of catabolism of folate (6) and a small\\nloss of folate via excretion from the urine, skin, and bile.

Folate deﬁ-\\nciency will also decrease the ﬂux through the methylation cycle but the DNA\\ncycle may be the more sensitive. The most obvious expression of the decrease\\nin the methylation cycle is an elevation in plasma homocysteine. This is due\\nto a decreased availability of new methyl groups provided as 5-methylte-\\ntrahydrofolate, necessary for the remethylation of plasma homocysteine.

In addition, it was suggested that\\nadequate folate status is reﬂected in a red cell folate level of greater than 150\\nmg/l. Of less relevance was a liver folate level of greater than 7.5mg/g, because\\nsuch values only occur in rare circumstances. A normal N-formino-l-gluta-\\nmate test was also cited as evidence of sufﬁciency, but this test has since been\\nlargely discredited and abandoned as not having any useful function (10).

Iodine\\n16.1 Role of iodine in human metabolic processes\\nAt present, the only physiological role known for iodine in the human body\\nis in the synthesis of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Therefore, the\\ndietary requirement of iodine is determined by normal thyroxine (T4) pro-\\nduction by the thyroid gland without stressing the thyroid iodide trapping\\nmechanism or raising thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.\\nIodine from the diet is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.\\nDietary iodine is converted into the iodide ion before it is absorbed. The\\niodide ion is 100% bioavailable and absorbed totally from food and water.\\nThis is, however, not true for iodine within thyroid hormones ingested for\\ntherapeutic purposes.\\nIodine enters the circulation as plasma inorganic iodide, which is cleared\\nfrom the circulation by the thyroid and kidney. The iodide is used by the\\nthyroid gland for synthesis of thyroid hormones, and the kidney excretes\\nexcess iodine with urine. The excretion of iodine in the urine is a good\\nmeasure of iodine intake. In a normal population with no evidence of clini-\\ncal iodine deﬁciency either in the form of endemic goitre or endemic cre-\\ntinism, urinary iodine excretion reﬂects the average daily iodine requirement.\\nTherefore, for determining the iodine requirements and the iodine intake, the\\nimportant indexes are serum T4 and TSH levels (exploring thyroid status) and\\nurinary iodine excretion (exploring iodine intake). A simpliﬁed diagram of\\nthe metabolic circuit of iodine is given in Figure 16.1.\\nAll biological actions of iodide are attributed to the thyroid hormones. The\\nmajor thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland is T4. T4 in circulation\\nis taken up by the cells and is de-iodinated by the enzyme 5¢-monodeiodinase\\nin the cytoplasm to convert it into triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of\\nthyroid hormone.

If iodine deﬁciency exists during this period and results in\\nthyroid hormone deﬁciency, the consequence is derangement in the develop-\\nment of the brain and central nervous system. These derangements are irre-\\nversible; the most serious form being that of cretinism. The effect of iodine\\ndeﬁciency at different stages of life is given in Table 16.1.\\nThe other physiological role of thyroid hormones is to control several\\nmetabolic processes in the body. These include carbohydrate, fat, protein,\\nvitamin, and mineral metabolism. For example, thyroid hormone increases\\nenergy production, increases lipolysis, and regulates neoglucogenesis, and\\nglycolysis.\\n16.2 Populations at risk for iodine deficiency\\nIodine deﬁciency affects all populations at all stages of life, from the intra-\\nuterine stage to old age, as shown in Table 16.1.

The iodine present in the upper crust of the earth is leached by\\nglaciation and repeated ﬂooding, and is carried to the sea. Seawater is, there-\\nfore, a rich source of iodine (6). The seaweed located near coral reefs has an\\ninherent biological capacity to concentrate iodine from the sea. The reef ﬁsh\\nwhich thrive on seaweed are also rich in iodine. Thus, a population consum-\\ning seaweed and reef ﬁsh will have a high intake of iodine, as is the case in\\nJapan. Iodine intakes by the Japanese are typically in the range of 2–3mg/day\\n(6). In several areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and parts of Europe, iodine\\nintake varies from 20 to 80mg/day. In Canada and the United States and some\\nparts of Europe, the intake is around 500mg/day. The average iodine content \\n16.

However, recent data indicate that the iodine content \\nof human milk varies markedly as a function of the iodine intake of the pop-\\nulation (10). For example, it ranges from 20 to 330mg/l in Europe and from 30\\nto 490mg/l in the United States (8, 10, 11). It is as low as 12mg/l in populations\\nexperiencing severe iodine deﬁciency (8, 10). On this basis, an average human-\\nmilk intake of 750ml/day would give an intake of iodine of about 60mg/day\\nin Europe and 120mg/day in the United States. The upper United States value\\n(490mg/l) would provide 368mg/day or 68mg/kg/day for a 5-kg infant.\\nPositive iodine balance in the young infant, which is required for increas-\\ning the iodine stores of the thyroid, is achieved only when the iodine intake\\nis at least 15mg/kg/day in term infants and 30mg/kg/day in pre-term infants\\n(12). The iodine requirement of pre-term infants is twice that of term infants\\nbecause of a much lower retention of iodine by pre-term infants (8, 12). Based\\non the assumption of an average body weight of 6kg for a child of 6 months, \\n15mg/kg/day corresponds approximately to an iodine intake and requirement\\nof 90mg/day. This value is twofold higher than the present United States \\nrecommendations.\\nOn the basis of these considerations, The World Health Organization\\n(WHO) in 2001 updated its 1996 recommendations (13) and proposed,\\ntogether with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Inter-'),\n",

A study by Tovar and colleagues (21) correlating 24-hour thyroid\\nradioiodine uptake and urinary iodine excretion in 9–13-year-old school-\\nchildren in rural Mexico suggested that an iodine intake in excess of 60mg/day\\nis associated with a 24-hour thyroidal radioiodine uptake below 30%. Lower\\nexcretion values are associated with higher uptake values. An iodine intake of\\n60mg/day is equivalent to 3mg/kg/day in an average size 10-year-old child\\n(approximate body weight of 20kg). An intake of 60–100mg/day for a child\\nof 1–10 years thus seems appropriate. These requirements are based on the\\nbody weight of Mexican children who participated in this study. The Food\\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations calculates the average\\nbody weight of a 10-year-old child as being 25kg. Using the higher average\\nbody weight, the iodine requirement for a 1–10-year-old child would be 90–\\n120mg/day.\\n16.4.3 Adults\\nA requirement for iodine of 150mg/day for adolescents and adults is justiﬁed'),\n",

It also provides the iodine intake necessary to\\nmaintain the plasma iodide level above the critical limit of 0.10mg/dl, which\\nis the average level likely to be associated with the onset of goitre (24). More-\\nover, this level of iodine intake is required to maintain the iodine stores of the\\nthyroid above the critical threshold of 10mg, below which an insufﬁcient level\\nof iodination of thyroglobulin leads to disorders in thyroid hormone \\nsynthesis (23).\\nData reﬂecting either iodine balance or its effect on thyroid physiology can\\nhelp to deﬁne optimal iodine intake. In adults and adolescents who consume\\nadequate amounts of iodine, most dietary iodine eventually appears in the\\nurine; thus, the urinary iodine concentration is a useful measure for assessing\\niodine intake (1, 23). For this, casual samples are sufﬁcient if enough are col-\\nlected and if they accurately represent a community (14, 25). A urinary iodine\\n16.

Correction of the iodine deﬁciency\\nwill bring all these measures back into the normal range. Recent data from\\nthe Thyro-Mobil project in Europe have conﬁrmed these relationships by\\nshowing that the largest thyroid sizes are associated with the lowest urinary\\niodine concentrations (26).

Similarly, recent data\\nfrom Australia show that the lowest serum TSH and thyroglobulin values\\nwere associated with urine containing 200–300mg iodine/g creatinine\\n(1.57–2.36mmol iodine/g creatinine) (28).\\nOther investigations followed serum TSH levels in adult subjects without\\nthyroid glands who were given graded doses of T4 and found that an average\\ndaily dose of 100mg T4 would require at least 65mg of iodine to be used with\\nmaximal efﬁciency by the thyroid in order to establish euthyroidism. In prac-\\ntice, such maximal efﬁciency is never obtained and therefore considerably\\nmore iodine is necessary. Data from controlled observations associated a low\\nurinary iodine concentration with a high goitre prevalence, high radioiodine\\nuptake, and low thyroidal organic iodine content (12).

In practice, the set of\\nfood combinations which provide nutritional adequacy are limited by the\\nlevel of food production sustainable in a given ecological setting. In addition,\\nthere are economic constraints that limit food supply at the household level.\\nThe development of food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) (1) recognizes\\nthis and focuses on how a combination of foods can meet nutrient require-\\nments rather than on how each speciﬁc nutrient is provided in adequate\\namounts.\\nThe ﬁrst step in the process of setting dietary guidelines is deﬁning the sig-\\nniﬁcant diet-related public health problems in a community.

This nutrient-based approach has served many\\npurposes but has not always fostered the establishment of nutritional and\\ndietary priorities consistent with the broad public health priorities at the\\nnational and international levels. It has permitted a more precise deﬁnition of\\nrequirements for essential nutrients but unfortunately has often been too nar-\\nrowly focused, concentrating on the precise nutrient requirement amount,\\nand not on solving the nutritional problems of the world.\\nIn contrast to RNIs, FBDGs are based on the fact that people eat food, not\\nnutrients. Deﬁning nutrient intakes alone is only part of the task of dealing\\nwith nutritional adequacy.

There is a need for\\na broadening of the food base and a diversiﬁcation of diets.

The nutrients selected for \\ndiscussion include those that are among the most difﬁcult to obtain in \\ncereal- and tuber-based diets (i.e. diets based on rice, corn, wheat, potato \\nor cassava). Moreover, nutrient deﬁciencies of vitamin A, iron, and zinc are\\nwidespread.\\n17.2.1 Vitamin A\\nThe vitamin A content of most staple diets can be signiﬁcantly improved with\\nthe addition of a relatively small portion of plant foods rich in carotenoids,\\nthe precursors of vitamin A. For example, a typical portion of cooked carrots\\n(50g) added to a daily diet, or 21g of carrots per 4.184MJ, provides 500mg\\nretinol equivalents, which is the recommended nutrient density for this\\nvitamin. The biological activity of provitamin A varies among different plant\\nsources; fruits and vegetables such as carrots, mango, papaya, and melon\\ncontain large amounts of nutritionally active carotenoids (3, 4). Green leafy\\nvegetables such as ivy gourd have been successfully used in Thailand as a\\nsource of vitamin A, and carotenoid-rich red palm oil serves as an easily avail-\\nable and excellent source of vitamin A in other countries. Consequently, a\\nregular portion of these foods included in an individual’s diet may provide\\n100% or more of the daily requirement for retinol equivalents (Figures\\n17.1–17.4b). Vitamin A is also present in animal food sources in a highly\\nbioavailable form. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibility of\\nmeeting vitamin A needs by including animal foods in the diet. For example,\\nproviding minor amounts of ﬁsh or chicken liver (20–25g) in the diet pro-\\nvides more than the recommended vitamin A nutrient density for virtually all\\npopulation groups.\\n17.2.2 Vitamin C\\nAn increased vitamin C intake can be achieved by including citrus fruit or'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='17.2.2 Vitamin C\\nAn increased vitamin C intake can be achieved by including citrus fruit or\\nother foods rich in ascorbic acid in the diet. For example, an orange or a small\\namount of other vitamin C-rich fruit (60g of edible portion) provides the \\nrecommended ascorbic acid density (Figures 17.1–17.3c). Adding an orange\\nper day to a potato-based diet increases the level of vitamin C threefold\\n(Figure 17.4c). Other good vitamin C food sources are guava, amla, kiwi, cran-\\nberries, strawberries, papaya, mango, melon, cantaloupe, spinach, Swiss chard,\\n17.

All these foods, when added to a diet\\nor meal in regular portion sizes, will signiﬁcantly improve the vitamin C\\ndensity. Because ascorbic acid is heat labile, minimal cooking (steaming or stir-\\nfrying) is recommended to maximize the bioavailable nutrient. The signiﬁ-\\ncance of consuming vitamin C with meals is discussed relative to iron\\nabsorption below (see also Chapter 13).\\n17.2.3 Folate\\nFolate is now considered signiﬁcant not only for the prevention of macro-\\ncytic anaemia, but also for normal fetal development. Recently, this vitamin\\nwas implicated in the maintenance of cardiovascular health and cognitive\\nfunction in the elderly. Staple diets consisting largely of cereal grains and\\ntubers are very low in folate but can be improved by the addition of legumes\\nor green leafy vegetables. For example, a regular portion of cooked lentils \\n(95g) added to a rice-based diet can provide an amount of folate sufﬁcient to\\nmeet the desirable nutrient density for this vitamin (Figure 17.1d). Other\\nlegumes such as beans and peas are also good sources of this vitamin, but\\nlarger portions are needed for folate sufﬁciency (100g beans and 170g peas).\\nCluster bean and colacasia leaves are excellent folate sources used in the Indian\\ndiet. Another good source of folate is chicken liver; only one portion (20–'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='diet. Another good source of folate is chicken liver; only one portion (20–\\n25g) is sufﬁcient to meet the desirable nutrient density for folate and vitamin\\nA simultaneously. The best sources of folate are organ meats, green leafy veg-\\netables, and Brussels sprouts. However, 50% or more of food folate is\\ndestroyed during cooking. Prolonged heating in large volumes of water\\nshould be avoided, and it is advisable to consume the water used in the\\ncooking of vegetables.\\n17.2.4 Iron and zinc\\nMinerals such as iron and zinc are found in low amounts in cereal- and tuber-\\nbased diets. The addition of legumes slightly improves the iron content of\\nsuch diets. However, the bioavailability of this non-haem iron source is low.\\nTherefore, it is not possible to meet the recommended levels of iron in the\\nstaple-based diets through a food-based approach unless some meat or ﬁsh is\\nincluded. For example, adding a small portion (50g) of ﬂesh food will increase\\nthe total iron content of the diet as well as the amount of bioavailable iron.\\nFor zinc, the presence of a small portion (50g) of ﬂesh food will secure dietary\\nsufﬁciency of most staple diets (Figures 17.1–17.4e).\\nThe consumption of ascorbic acid along with food rich in iron will enhance\\niron’s absorption. There is a critical balance between enhancers and inhibitors\\nof iron absorption. Nutritional status can be improved signiﬁcantly by edu-\\ncating households about food preparation practices that minimize the con-\\nsumption of inhibitors of iron absorption; for example, the fermentation \\nof phytate-containing grains before the baking of breads to enhance iron\\nabsorption.\\n17.3 How to accomplish dietary diversity in practice\\nIt is essential to create strategies which promote and facilitate dietary diver-\\nsiﬁcation in order to achieve complementarity of cereal- or tuber-based diets\\nwith foods rich in micronutrients in populations with limited ﬁnancial\\nresources or access to food.

Support for small-scale\\nvegetable and fruit growing should lead to increased production and con-\\nsumption of micronutrient-rich foods (e.g. legumes, green leafy vegetables,\\nand fruits) at the household level. The success of such projects depends on\\na good knowledge and understanding of local conditions as well as the\\ninvolvement of women and the community in general. These are key ele-\\nments for supporting, achieving, and sustaining beneﬁcial nutritional\\nchange at the household level. Land availability and water supply are often\\nconstraints, and may require local government support before they are\\novercome. The educational effort should be directed towards securing\\nappropriate within-family distribution, which considers the needs of the\\nmost vulnerable members of the family, especially infants and young \\nchildren.\\n• Raising of ﬁsh, poultry, and small animals (rabbits, goats, and guinea pigs).\\nFlesh foods are excellent sources of highly bioavailable essential micronu-\\ntrients such as vitamin A, iron, and zinc. Raising animals at the local level\\nmay permit communities to access foods which otherwise would not be\\navailable because of their high costs.

This will serve pre-\\ndominantly the urban and non-food-producing rural areas.\\n• Reduction of post-harvest losses of the nutritional value of micronutrient-\\nrich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Improvement of storage and \\nfood-preservation facilities signiﬁcantly reduces post-harvest losses. \\nAt the household level, the promotion of effective cooking methods and\\npractical ways of preserving foods (e.g. solar drying of seasonal micronu-\\ntrient-rich foods such as papaya, grapes, mangoes, peaches, tomatoes, \\nand apricots) may preserve signiﬁcant amounts of micronutrients in \\nfoods, which in turn will lead to an increase of these nutrients in the diet.\\nAt the commercial level, appropriate grading, packing, transport, and mar-\\nketing practices can reduce losses, stimulate economic growth, and opti-\\nmize income generation.\\n• Improvement of micronutrient levels in soils and plants, which will improve\\nthe composition of plant foods and enhance yields. Current agricultural\\npractices can improve the micronutrient content of foods by correcting soil\\nquality and pH and by increasing soil mineral content where it has been\\ndepleted by erosion and poor soil conservation practices.

The support of local authorities and gov-\\nernment may facilitate the implementation of such projects because these\\nactions require economic resources, which are sometimes beyond the reach\\nof those most in need of dietary diversity.\\n17.4 Practices which will enhance the success of food-\\nbased approaches\\nTo achieve dietary adequacy of vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, iron, and zinc\\nby using food-based approaches, food preparation and dietary practices must\\nbe considered. For example, it is important to recommend that vegetables rich\\nin vitamin C, folate, and other water-soluble or heat-labile vitamins are min-\\nimally cooked in small amounts of water. In the case of iron, it is essential to\\nreduce the intake of inhibitors of iron absorption and to increase the intake\\nof enhancers of absorption in a given meal. Following this strategy, it is rec-\\nommended to increase the intake of germinated seeds; fermented cereals; heat-\\nprocessed cereals; meats; and fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C. In\\naddition, the consumption of tea, coffee, chocolate, or herbal infusions should\\nbe encouraged at times other than with meals (see Chapter 13). Consumption\\nof ﬂesh foods improves zinc absorption whereas it is inhibited by consump-\\ntion of diets high in phytate, such as diets based on unreﬁned cereals. Zinc\\navailability can be estimated according to the phytate–zinc molar ratio of the\\nmeal (6) (see Chapter 12).\\nThis advice is particularly important for people who consume cereal-\\nbased and tuber-based diets.

Other alternatives—fortiﬁcation and supple-\\nmentation—have been proposed as stopgap measures when food-based\\napproaches are not feasible or are still under development. There is a deﬁnite\\nrole for fortiﬁcation in meeting iron, folate, iodine, and zinc needs. Fortiﬁca-\\ntion and supplementation should be seen as complementary to food-based\\nstrategies and not as a replacement. Combined implementation of these strate-\\ngies can lead to substantial improvements in normalizing the micronutrient\\nstatus of populations at risk. Food-based approaches usually take longer to\\nimplement than supplementation programmes, but once established they are\\ntruly sustainable.\\n17.5 Delineating the role of supplementation and food\\nfortification for micronutrients which cannot be\\nsupplied by food\\nUnder ideal conditions of food access and availability, food diversity should\\nsatisfy micronutrient and energy needs of the general population. Unfortu-\\nnately, for many people in the world, the access to a variety of micronutrient-\\nrich foods is not possible. As demonstrated in the analysis of cereal- and\\ntuber-based diets (see Figures 17.1–17.4), micronutrient-rich foods, including\\nsmall amounts of ﬂesh foods and a variety of plant foods (vegetables and\\nfruits), are needed daily. This may not be realistic at present for many com-\\nmunities living under conditions of poverty. Food fortiﬁcation and food sup-\\nplementation are important alternatives which complement food-based\\napproaches to satisfy the nutritional needs of people in developing and devel-\\noped countries.\\n17.

This approach is accepted\\nas sustainable under most conditions and is often cost effective on a large scale\\nwhen successfully implemented. Both iron fortiﬁcation of wheat ﬂour and\\niodine fortiﬁcation of salt are examples of fortiﬁcation strategies that have\\nproduced excellent results (7).\\nThere are at least three essential conditions which must be met in any for-\\ntiﬁcation programme (7, 8): the fortiﬁcant should be effective, bioavailable,\\nacceptable, and affordable; the selected food vehicle should be easily accessi-\\nble and a speciﬁed amount of it should be regularly consumed in the local\\ndiet; and detailed production instructions and monitoring procedures should\\nbe in place and enforced by law.\\nIron fortification\\nFood fortiﬁcation with iron is recommended when dietary iron is in-\\nsufﬁcient or the dietary iron is of poor bioavailability, which is the reality \\nfor most people in the developing world and for vulnerable population groups\\nin the developed world. Moreover, the prevalence of iron deﬁciency \\nand anaemia in vegetarians and in populations of the developing world which\\nrely on cereal or tuber foods is signiﬁcantly higher than in omnivorous \\npopulations.\\nIron is present in foods in two forms, as haem iron, which is derived \\nfrom ﬂesh foods (meats and ﬁsh), and as non-haem iron, which is the \\ninorganic form present in plant foods such as legumes, grains, nuts, and \\nvegetables (9, 10). Haem iron is the more readily absorbed (20–30%) and its \\nbioavailability is relatively unaffected by dietary factors. Non-haem iron \\nhas a lower rate of absorption (2–10%), depending on the balance \\nbetween iron absorption inhibitors (e.g. phytates, polyphenols, calcium, \\nand phosphate) and iron absorption enhancers (e.g. ascorbic and citric acids, \\ncysteine-containing peptides, ethanol, and fermentation products) present'),\n",

Because staple foods around the world provide pre-\\ndominantly non-haem iron sources of low bioavailability, the tradi-\\ntionally eaten staple foods represent an excellent vehicle for iron fortiﬁcation.\\nExamples of foods that have been fortiﬁed are wheat ﬂour, corn \\n(maize) ﬂour, rice, salt, sugar, cookies, curry powder, ﬁsh sauce, and soy \\nsauce (9). Nevertheless, the beneﬁcial effects of consumption of iron \\nabsorption enhancers have been extensively proven and should always be \\npromoted (i.e. consumption of a vitamin C-rich food together with the non-\\nhaem iron source).\\nIodine fortification\\nIodine is sparsely distributed in the Earth’s surface and foods grown in \\nsoils with little or no iodine lack an adequate amount of this micronutrient.\\nThis situation had made iodine deﬁciency disorders exceedingly common in\\nmost of the world and highly prevalent in many countries before the \\nintroduction of salt iodination (11). Only foods of marine origin are naturally\\nrich sources of iodine. Salt is a common food used by most people \\nworldwide, and the establishment of a well-implemented permanent salt-\\niodination programme has been proven to eradicate iodine deﬁciency \\ndisorders. Universal salt iodination is the best way to virtually eliminate\\niodine deﬁciency disorders (5).\\nHowever, salt iodination is not simply a matter of legislating the manda-\\ntory iodination of salt. It is important to determine the best fortiﬁcation tech-\\nnique, coordinate the implementation at all salt production sites, establish\\neffective monitoring and quality control programmes, and measure the iodine\\nfortiﬁcation level periodically. The difﬁculties in implementing salt iodination\\nprogrammes arise primarily when the salt industry is widely dispersed among\\nmany small producers.

The actual amount should be speciﬁed according to the\\nlevel of salt intake and the magnitude of the deﬁcit at the country level,\\nbecause iodine must be added within safe and effective ranges. Thus, it is very\\nimportant to implement a monitoring plan to control the amount of iodine\\nin the salt at the consumer’s table (11, 12). Additionally, United Nations agen-\\ncies responsible for assisting governments in establishing iodination pro-\\ngrammes should provide technical support for programme implementation,\\nmonitoring, and evaluation to ensure sustainability.\\nZinc fortification\\nThe body depends on a regular zinc supply provided by the daily diet because\\nstores are quite limited. Food diversity analysis demonstrates that it is virtu-\\nally impossible to achieve zinc adequacy in the absence of a ﬂesh food source\\n(see Figures 17.1–17.4). Among ﬂesh foods, beef is the best source of zinc,\\nfollowed by poultry and then ﬁsh. Zinc fortiﬁcation programmes are being\\nstudied, especially for populations that consume predominately plant foods.\\nFortiﬁcation of cereal staple foods is a potentially attractive intervention\\nwhich could beneﬁt the whole population as well as target the vulnerable pop-\\nulation groups, namely children and pregnant women.

Elevated plasma homocysteine levels are considered to be\\nan independent risk factor for heart disease; a higher intake of folic acid may\\nalso beneﬁt the rest of the population because it may lower homocysteine\\nlevels in adults (see Chapter 15). In addition, folate may improve the mental\\ncondition of the elderly population (13, 14).\\nAlthough the desirable folic acid density may be achieved through dietary\\ndiversity, it requires the daily presence of organ meats, green leafy vegetables,\\npulses, legumes, or nuts in the diet (15). Most population groups may not\\neasily reach the appropriate level of folic acid consumption; therefore, folic\\nacid fortiﬁcation has been recommended. The United States initiated manda-\\ntory folic acid fortiﬁcation of cereal-grain products in January 1998.

As established at the\\nInternational Conference on Nutrition (17), nutritional supplementation\\nshould be restricted to vulnerable groups which cannot meet their nutrient\\nneeds through food (e.g. women of childbearing age, infants and young chil-\\ndren, elderly people, low socioeconomic groups, displaced people, refugees,\\nand populations experiencing other emergency situations).

Their primary purpose is to educate health-\\ncare professionals and consumers about health promotion and disease pre-\\nvention. In this way, priorities in establishing dietary guidelines can address\\nthe relevant public health concerns whether they are related to dietary insuf-\\nﬁciency or excess. In this context, meeting the nutritional needs of popula-\\ntions takes its place as one of the components of food and nutrition policy\\ngoals along with the priorities included in the FBDGs for improved health\\nand nutrition for a given population.\\nThe world nutrition and health situation demonstrates that the major\\ncauses of death and disability have been traditionally related to malnutrition\\nin developing countries and to the imbalance between energy intake and\\nexpenditure (which lead to obesity and other chronic diseases—diabetes, car-\\ndiovascular disease, hypertension, and stroke) in industrialized countries. The\\ntragedy is that many suffer from too little food while others have diseases\\nresulting from too much food; both, however, would beneﬁt from a more bal-\\nanced distribution of food and other resources. Although the nature of the\\nhealth and nutrition problems in these two contrasting groups is very differ-\\nent, the dietary guidelines required to improve both situations are not.

The latter group places an undue demand on land, water, and\\nother resources required for intensive food production, which makes the\\ntypical Western diet not only undesirable from the standpoint of health but\\nalso environmentally unsustainable. If energy intake is balanced with the\\nexpenditure required for basal metabolism, physical activity, growth, and cel-\\nlular repair, the dietary quality required for health is essentially the same\\nacross population groups.\\nEfforts in nutrition education and health promotion should include a\\nstrong encouragement for active lifestyles.

Thus, the\\napparent conﬂicting goals—eradicating malnutrition while preventing over-\\nnutrition—are resolved by promoting an appropriate energy balance, which\\nwill lead to a normal BMI. Moreover, given that FBDGs should be ecologi-\\ncally sustainable, the types and amounts of foods included in a balanced diet\\nare not very different for promoting adequate nutrition in the impoverished\\nand preventing overnutrition in the afﬂuent.\\nThis is well exempliﬁed by the similarities in the FBDGs across countries,\\nwhether represented by pyramids, rainbows, dishes or pots.

It is obvious that\\nconsumption of excess energy will induce an increase in energy stores, which\\nmay lead to obesity and related health complications. Populations should\\nconsume nutritionally adequate and varied diets, based primarily on foods of\\nplant origin with small amounts of added ﬂesh foods. Households across all\\nregions should select predominantly plant-based diets rich in a variety of \\nvegetables and fruits, pulses or legumes, and minimally processed starchy\\nstaple foods. The evidence that such diets will prevent or delay a signiﬁcant\\nproportion of noncommunicable chronic diseases is consistent. A predomi-\\nnantly plant-based diet has a low energy density, which may protect against\\nobesity. This should not exclude small amounts of animal foods, which \\nmake an important nutritional contribution to plant-food-based diets, as \\nillustrated in the examples presented earlier (Figures 17.1–17.4).

Moreover, nutrient deﬁciencies of vitamin A, iron, and zinc are\\nwidespread.\\n17.2.1 Vitamin A\\nThe vitamin A content of most staple diets can be signiﬁcantly improved with\\nthe addition of a relatively small portion of plant foods rich in carotenoids,\\nthe precursors of vitamin A. For example, a typical portion of cooked carrots\\n(50g) added to a daily diet, or 21g of carrots per 4.184MJ, provides 500mg\\nretinol equivalents, which is the recommended nutrient density for this\\nvitamin. The biological activity of provitamin A varies among different plant\\nsources; fruits and vegetables such as carrots, mango, papaya, and melon\\ncontain large amounts of nutritionally active carotenoids (3, 4). Green leafy\\nvegetables such as ivy gourd have been successfully used in Thailand as a\\nsource of vitamin A, and carotenoid-rich red palm oil serves as an easily avail-\\nable and excellent source of vitamin A in other countries. Consequently, a\\nregular portion of these foods included in an individual’s diet may provide\\n100% or more of the daily requirement for retinol equivalents (Figures\\n17.1–17.4b). Vitamin A is also present in animal food sources in a highly\\nbioavailable form. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibility of\\nmeeting vitamin A needs by including animal foods in the diet. For example,\\nproviding minor amounts of ﬁsh or chicken liver (20–25g) in the diet pro-\\nvides more than the recommended vitamin A nutrient density for virtually all\\npopulation groups.\\n17.2.2 Vitamin C\\nAn increased vitamin C intake can be achieved by including citrus fruit or')"
